    #+begin_quote
    If you start with poorly separated services, you're likely to end up with the same monolith you tried to avoid, with added network overhead and complex tooling to manage this mess (also known as a distributed monolith). You will just replace highly coupled modules with highly coupled services. And because now everyone runs a Kubernetes cluster, you may even think you're following the industry standards.
