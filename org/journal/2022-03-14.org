  - In another post, a Gen Z user rips into millennials with the claim that they have underperformed as a generation. "Y'all were supposed to be saving the climate, starting revolutions and shit. What did you contribute? Mumford and Sons? A craft brewery on every corner?"
  - Unlike users of Twitter or Instagram, [[#TikTok][TikTok]] users do not need to "follow" any accounts before they're served content. Instead, a mysterious, uncannily accurate algorithm intuits the user's preferences and presents them in a so-called "For You" page.
  - This intimacy may also be the reason for Gen Z's generational allegiance. Where millennials were cloaked in mostly faceless anonymity online (on [[#LiveJournal][LiveJournal]], Tumblr, Twitter) or highly curated photography (Facebook, Instagram), Gen Z's digital life is dominated by the near-constant production of images and videos of themselves (Snapchat, [[#TikTok][TikTok]]), creating a very different relationship between them, their peers, and the rest of the world.

    - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
    - In the blockchain world, these are called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). In a typical DAO, the way to become a member is to acquire "tokens", giving access to a vote weighted proportionally to the number of tokens you hold

    - about storing ownership claims
    - also a currency is a ownership claim
      - but it doesn't matter which coins exactly I own
      - all that matters is their quantity
    - In contrast, an NFT is a unique token and the Blockchain conveys my ownership of exactly that unique token.
