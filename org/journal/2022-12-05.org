    The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and
    magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the
    CI/CD ecosystem, including -

    - The compromise of the SolarWinds build system, used to spread malware
      through to 18,000 customers.
    - The Codecov breach, that led to exfiltration of secrets stored within
      environment variables in thousands of build pipelines across numerous
      enterprises.
    - The PHP breach, resulting in publication of a malicious version of PHP
      containing a backdoor.
    - The Dependency Confusion flaw, which affected dozens of giant enterprises,
      and abuses flaws in the way external dependencies are fetched to run
      malicious code on developer workstations and build environments.
    - The compromises of the ua-parser-js, coa and rc NPM packages, with
      millions of weekly downloads each, resulting in malicious code running on
      millions of build environments and developer workstations.
