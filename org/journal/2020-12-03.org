  - Start with a small project
  - Lots of devs write code, but writing good software is hard
  - ([[id:b2831721-165d-4943-a41a-da770d96be41][Golang]]) is backwards compatible
  - doesn't do to much magic (like Ruby)
    - is also an advantage
  - It might be a good start for a CLI tool
  - Managers don't need to hire Go talents
    - a motivated dev might easily learn it
    - managers are not aware about that (also lots of non-gophers search jobs with Go because they want to learn the language)
  - be clear about expectations (if Go code can do better than others)
