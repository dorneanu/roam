  ROP stands for Return-Oriented Programming. It is primarily used to defeat
  DEP/NX/W^X (Data Execution Prevention/No Execute/Write xor Execute) mitigations
  in processors. Different manufacturers have different names for this particular
  feature, but the idea is to mark certain areas of memory (notably stack and
  heap) as non-executable. This makes attempts to execute instructions from areas
  marked as non-executable cause an exeception (SEGFAULT). This mitigates generic
  buffer overflow attacks, which usually involve writing some shellcode into
  memory (usually the stack) and overwriting the saved return pointer or some
  other way to jump to the shellcode and execute it. Since the stack is marked as
  non-executable, the shellcode is not executed and a SEGFAULT is raised
