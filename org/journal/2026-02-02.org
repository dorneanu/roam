    I really like capitalize-dwim, downcase-dwim, and upcase-dwim and think they should be bound to M-c, M-l and M-u by default (instead of capitalize-word, downcase-word, and upcase-word).

    One can even do all this in a single command, bound to, e.g., `M-c`:

    (defun +case-cycle ()
      "Cycle case of current word."
      (interactive)
      (save-mark-and-excursion
        (let (deactivate-mark)
          (when-let* ((b (or (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'region)
                             (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'word)))
                      (w (buffer-substring (car b) (cdr b))))
            (goto-char (car b))
            (funcall (cond
                      ((equal (upcase w) w) #'downcase-region)
                      ((equal (downcase w) w) #'capitalize-region)
                      (t #'upcase-region))
                     (car b) (cdr b))))))
