  - Some mitigations
    #+begin_quote
    - Enable mandatory *2fa* within your Github organization (if you don't use an
    organization, you probably should)

    - *Disable* the ability to fork repos in your organization

    - Configure and enable mandatory SAML authentication. In combination with
    mandatory 2fa, this makes phishing and even key leakage less likely (specific
    keys need to be double authorized for SAML, so that random private key you have
    on a random CI/CD platform from a few years ago can't access repos in SAML
    organizations even if it's leaked)

    - Disable the ability to *make repos public at the organization level*

    These are some quick setting changes that should address at least 3 of the 4
    main issues in the article.

    Additional suggestion:

    *Enable branch protection* on master. Require at least 1 peer review to merge
    anything in it. Enforce branch restrictions to include repo admins so
    restrictions can't be bypassed. This should stop obvious mistakes like
    accidentally committing .git or random credentials.
