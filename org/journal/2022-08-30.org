  #+begin_quote
  One of the *AWS serverless design principles* is to _share nothing_, and
  separating your microservices to individual repositories makes it easy to not
  accidentally do something you shouldn't.

  Build _self-containing_ services. Don't build stacks that require resources from other
  services in order to deploy. However, you can (and should!) build microservices that
  depend on others to satisfy business processes through loose coupling via API calls
  or events.

  If you're looking to get started with [[id:adce7f16-ab79-4935-b73e-71f3740a071f][*microservices]]*, don't forget they are *driven by
  domain*. When looking to "break up the monolith" start by identifying the discrete
  pieces of your application. Find the *areas of the application that have enough
  business logic* to be on their own and iterated separately from everything else.
