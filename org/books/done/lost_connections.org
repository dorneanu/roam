** Part 1: The Crack in the old story (27)
*** The Wand (28)

With any drug there always comes a story: 

#+begin_quote
But Irving was also one of the leading experts in the world in a field of science that
began right back in Bath when John Haygarth first waved his false wand. At that time, the
English doctor had realized that when you give a patient a medical treatment, you are
really giving her *two things*. *You are giving her a drug, which will usually have a
chemical effect on her body in some way. And you are giving her a story—about how the
treatment will affect her*.
#+end_quote

Prozac and some false research: 

#+begin_quote
He learned right away that the drug companies had—for years—been selectively publishing
research, and to a greater degree than he expected. *For example, in one trial for Prozac,
the drug was given to 245 patients, but the drug company published the results for only
twenty-seven of them*. *Those twenty-seven patients9 were the ones the drug seemed to work*
#+end_quote

The Hamilton scale: 

#+begin_quote
Scientists measure the depth of someone’s depression using something named the Hamilton
scale, which was invented by a scientist named Max Hamilton in 1959. *The Hamilton scale
ranges from 0 (where you’re skipping along merrily) to 51 (where you’re jumping in front
of trains)*. To give you a yardstick: you can get a six-point leap in your Hamilton score
if you improve your sleeping patterns. What Irving found is that, in the real data that
hadn’t been run through a PR filter, antidepressants do cause an improvement in the
Hamilton score—*they do make depressed people feel better. It’s an improvement of 1.8
points*.
#+end_quote

Irvin Kirsch: 

#+begin_quote
When *Irving Kirsch* discovered that these [[id:2b6e8820-a254-4138-ad80-dc71c97a8082][serotonin]]-boosting drugs were not having the
effects that everyone was being sold, he began—to his surprise—to ask an even more basic
question. *What’s the evidence, he began to wonder, that depression is caused primarily by
an imbalance of serotonin, or any other chemical, in the brain? Where did it come from?*
#+end_quote

*** Imbalance (38)
#+begin_quote
After twenty years researching this at the highest level, Irving has come to believe that
the notion depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is just “an accident of history,”
produced by scientists initially misreading what they were seeing, and then drug companies
selling that misperception to the world to cash in. And so, Irving says, the primary
explanation for depression offered in our culture starts to fall apart. The idea you feel
terrible because of a “chemical imbalance” was built on a series of mistakes and errors.
It has come as close to being proved wrong, he told me, as you ever get in science. It’s
lying broken on the floor, like a neurochemical Humpty Dumpty with a very sad smile.
#+end_quote

- Depression cause: Irving views the "chemical imbalance" explanation as an "accident of history."
- Origin: Resulted from initial scientific misinterpretations and subsequent pharmaceutical company promotion.
- Cultural understanding: Current primary explanation for depression is falling apart.
- Chemical imbalance theory: Largely discredited in science.
- Current state: Theory is "lying broken on the floor."

*** The Grief Exception (50)
#+begin_quote
But this blasts a hole in the rudder of the boat the psychiatrists writing the DSM have
been sailing in for so long. Suddenly, life—with all its complexity—starts to flood into
diagnosing depression and anxiety. It can’t just be a matter of chemical imbalance, as
verified by checklists of symptoms. It would have to be seen as a response to your
circumstances.
#+end_quote

Depression as a disconnection from ourselves, from others: 

#+begin_quote
As she said this, I told her that in thirteen years of being handed ever higher doses of
antidepressants, no doctor ever asked me if there was any reason why I might be feeling so
distressed. She told me I’m not unusual—and it’s a disaster. The message my doctors gave
me—*that our pain is simply a result of a malfunctioning brain—makes us, she told me,
“disconnected from ourselves, which leads to disconnection from others*.”
#+end_quote

Mental health should be become emotional health: 

#+begin_quote
In most cases, Joanne says, we would have to stop talking about “mental health”—which
conjures pictures of brain scans and defective synapses—and start talking about “emotional
health.” “*Why do we call it mental health?” she asked me. “Because we want to scientize
it. We want to make it sound scientific. But it’s our emotions.*”
#+end_quote

Depression as a form of grief: 

#+begin_quote
I was beginning to think there was something significant about the fact that grief and
depression have identical symptoms. Then one day, after interviewing several depressed
people, I asked myself: What if depression is, in fact, a form of grief—for our own lives
not being as they should? What if it is a form of grief for the connections we have lost,
yet still need?

*** The First Flag on the Moon (57)
** Part 2: Disconnection: Nine Causes of Depression
*** Picking up the flag (69)
*** Cause one: Disconnection from meaningful work (71)
#+begin_quote
As a result of this research, and the science it opened up, “the notion of what
constitutes stress at work has undergone a revolution,” Michael explains. The worst stress
for people isn’t having to bear a lot of responsibility. It is, he told me, having to
endure “work [that] is monotonous, boring, soul-destroying; [where] they die a little when
they come to work each day, because their work touches no part of them that is them.” Joe,
then, in his paint shop, by this real standard, had one of the most stressful jobs there
is. “Disempowerment,” Michael told me, “is at the heart12 of poor health”—physical,
mental, and emotional.
#+end_quote

- Stress at work: Definition revolutionized by research findings.
- Worst stress factor: Monotonous, boring, soul-destroying work.
- Impact: Work that doesn't engage individuals leads to physical, mental, and emotional health issues.

*** Cause two: Disconnection from other people (83)

On being "homesick": 

#+begin_quote
When we talk about home today, we mean just our four walls and (if we’re lucky) our
nuclear family. But that’s never been what home has meant to any humans before us. To
them, it meant a community—a dense web of people all around us, a tribe. But that is
largely gone. *Our sense of home has shriveled so far and so fast it no longer meets our
need for a sense of belonging. So we are homesick even when we are at home*.
#+end_quote

Why people post on social media: 

#+begin_quote
The comedian Marc Maron once wrote that “*every status update is a just a variation on a
single request: ‘Would someone please acknowledge me?*’
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
There’s a quote from the biologist E. O. Wilson that John Cacioppo—who has taught us so
much about loneliness—likes: *“People must belong to a tribe.” Just like a bee goes haywire
if it loses its hive, a human will go haywire if she loses her connection to the group*.
#+end_quote
*** Cause three: Disconnection from meaninful values (102)

Consumerism & work: 

#+begin_quote
And the pressure, in our culture, runs overwhelmingly one way—*spend more; work more*. We
live under a system, Tim says, that constantly “distracts us from what’s really good about
life.” We are being propagandized to live in a way that doesn’t meet our basic
psychological needs—*so we are left with a permanent, puzzling sense of dissatisfaction*.
#+end_quote

Intrinsic vs extrinsic values: 
 
#+begin_quote
“On Friday at four, I can stay [in my office] and work more—or I can go home and play with
my kids,” he told me. “I can’t do both. It’s one or the other. If my materialistic values
are bigger, I’m going to stay and work. If my family values are bigger, I’m going to go
home and play with my kids.” It’s not that materialistic people don’t care about their
kids—but “*as the materialistic values get bigger, other values are necessarily going to be
crowded out,” he says, even if you tell yourself they won’t*.
#+end_quote

Advertising makes us feel bad: 

#+begin_quote
Tim suspected that advertising plays a key role in why we are, every day, choosing a value
system that makes us feel worse. So with another social scientist named Jean Twenge,21 he
tracked the percentage of total U.S. national wealth that’s spent on advertising, from
1976 to 2003—and he discovered that the more money is spent on ads, the more materialistic
teenagers become. A few years ago, an advertising agency head named Nancy Shalek22
explained approvingly: “*Advertising at its best is making people feel that without their
product, you’re a loser. Kids are very sensitive to that … You open up emotional
vulnerabilities, and it’s very easy to do with kids because they’re the most emotionally
vulnerable*.
#+end_quote

Adertising and the ego: 

#+begin_quote
When they talk among themselves, *advertising people have been admitting since the 1920s
that their job is to make people feel inadequate—and then offer their product as the
solution to the sense of inadequacy they have created*. Ads are the ultimate
frenemy—they’re always saying: Oh babe, I want you to look/smell/feel great; it makes me
so sad that that at the moment you’re ugly/stinking/miserable; here’s this thing that will
make you into the person you and I really want you to be. Oh, did I mention you have to
pay a few bucks? I just want you to be the person you deserve to be. Isn’t that worth a
few dollars? *You’re worth it*.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
One of his proudest moments was when one of his sons came home one day and said: “Dad,
some kids at school are making fun of my sneakers.” They were not a brand name, or
shiny-new. “Oh, what’d you say to them?” Tim asked. His son explained he looked at them
and said: “*Why do you care?*” He was nonplussed—he could see that what they valued was
empty, and absurd.
#+end_quote

Problem with shopping malls: 

#+begin_quote
“But I think part of why people are depressed is that our society is not set up in order
to help people live lifestyles, have jobs, participate in the economy, [or] participate in
their neighborhoods” in ways that support their intrinsic values. The change Tim saw
happening in Florida as a kid—when the beachfronts were transformed into shopping malls
and people shifted their attention there—has happened to the whole cultur
#+end_quote
*** Cause four: Disconnection from childhood trauma (117)
Obesity and the real causes: 

#+begin_quote
“When you look at a house burning down, the most obvious manifestation is the huge smoke
billowing out,” he told me. It would be easy, then, to think that the smoke is the
problem, and if you deal with the smoke, you’ve solved it. But “thank God that fire
departments understand that the piece that you treat is the piece you don’t see—the flames
inside, not the smoke billowing out. Otherwise, house fires would be treated by bringing
big fans to blow the smoke away. [And that would] make the house burn down faster.”
*Obesity, he realized, isn’t the fire. It’s the smoke*.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
turned out that *for every category of traumatic experience you went through as a kid, you
were radically more likely to become depressed as an adult*. If you had six categories of
traumatic events in your childhood, you were five times9 more likely to become depressed
as an adult than somebody who didn’t have any. If you had seven categories of traumatic
events as a child, you were 3,100 percent more likely to attempt to commit suicide as an
adult.
#+end_quote

Depression and emotional abuse: 

#+begin_quote
Curiously, it turned out emotional abuse was more likely to cause depression than any
other kind of trauma—even sexual molestation. Being treated cruelly by your parents was
the biggest driver of depression, out of all these categories.
#+end_quote
*** Cause five: Disconnection from status and respect (128)

#+begin_quote
After I learned about this, I began to wonder—especially as I interviewed many depressed
people—*if depression is, in part, a response to the sense of humiliation the modern world
inflicts on many of us*. *Watch TV and you’ll be told the only people who count in the world
are celebrities and the rich—and you already know your chances of joining either group are
vanishingly small*. Flick through an Instagram feed or a glossy magazine, and your
normal-shaped body will feel disgusting to you. Go to work and you’ll have to obey the
whims of a distant boss earning hundreds of times more than you. Even when we are not
being actively humiliated, even more of us feel like our status could be taken away at any
moment. Even the middle class—even the rich—are being made to feel pervasively insecure.
*Robert had discovered that having an insecure status was the one thing even more
distressing than having a low status*.
#+end_quote
*** Cause six: Disconnection from the natural world (136)
*** Cause seven: Disconnection from a hopeful or secure future (146)
*** Causes eight and nine: The real role of genes and brain changes (158)

Being depressed for a long time causes increased nervous activity in specific brain areas: 

#+begin_quote
Because you are feeling intense pain for a long period, your brain will assume this is the
state in which you are going to have to survive from now on—so it might start to shed the
synapses that relate to the things that give you joy and pleasure, and strengthen the
synapses that relate to fear and despair. *That’s one reason why you can often start to
feel you have become somehow fixed in a state of depression or anxiety even if the
original causes of the pain seem to have passed*. John
#+end_quote

Genes and depression: 

#+begin_quote
Yet there was a catch. We are all born with a genetic inheritance—but your genes are
activated by the environment. They can be switched on, or off, by what happens to you. And
Avshalom discovered—as Professor Robert Sapolsky explains—“that if you have a particular
flavor of 5-HTT, you have a greatly increased risk of depression, but only in a certain
environment.” If you carried this gene, the study showed, you were more likely to become
depressed—but only if you had experienced a terribly stressful event, or a great deal of
childhood trauma. (They didn’t test for most of the other causes of depression I’ve been
talking about here, such as loneliness, so we don’t know if they also interact with genes
in this way
#+end_quote

- Genetic inheritance: Genes can be activated or deactivated by environmental factors.
- Depression risk: Carrying a specific gene variant increases depression risk only in
  certain environments.
- Risk factors: Increased likelihood of depression with a stressful event or childhood
  trauma.
- Interaction with genes: Some causes of depression may interact with genes in a similar
  fashion.

Feminism in the 1950s: 

#+begin_quote
Picture a 1950s housewife living before modern feminism.She goes to her doctor to say
there is something terribly wrong with her. She says something like: “I have everything a
woman could possibly want. I have a good husband who provides for me. I have a nice house
with a picket fence. I have two healthy children. I have a car. I have nothing to be
unhappy about. But look at me—I feel terrible. I must be broken inside. Please—can I have
some Valium?” The feminist classics talk a lot about women like this. There were millions
of women saying things just like it. And the women meant what they said. They were
sincere. Yet now, if we could go back in a time machine and talk to these women, what we’d
say is: You had everything a woman could possibly want by the standards of the culture.
You had nothing to be unhappy about by the standards of the culture. But we now know that
the standards of the culture were wrong. Women need more than a house and a car and a
husband and kids. They need equality, and meaningful work, and autonomy. You aren’t
broken, we’d tell them. The culture is.
#+end_quote

- Societal standards: Emphasized traditional gender roles and domesticity for women.
- Unrealistic expectations: Women felt unfulfilled despite having material comfort.
- Cultural perception: Happiness equated to having a good husband, children, and a home.
- Feminist critique: Highlighted the need for equality, meaningful work, and autonomy for women.
- Empowerment: Challenged the idea that women were inherently broken for desiring more
  than societal norms.

#+begin_quote
It turns out that you were more likely to hurt somebody if you believed their mental
illness was the result of their biochemistry than if you believed it was the result of
what had happened to them in life. Believing depression was a disease didn’t reduce
hostility. In fact, it increased it.
#+end_quote

See depression as a reaction to the way we are living: 

#+begin_quote
This experiment—like so much of what I had learned—hints at something. For a long time, we have been told there are only two ways of thinking about depression. Either it’s a moral failing—a sign of weakness—or it’s a brain disease. Neither has worked well in ending depression, or in ending its stigma. But everything I had learned suggests that there’s a third option—to regard depression as largely a reaction to the way we are living
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
“Things have changed in psychiatry,”24 he said—and he then explained to me two more
crucial reasons why we are being told stories only about our brains and our genes.
“Psychiatry has undergone a real constriction from this bio-psycho-social approach. While
some people still pay lip service to it, mainstream psychiatry has become very
biological.” He furrowed his brow. “It’s very problematic.” We have ended up with “a
grossly oversimplified picture” of depression that he said “doesn’t look at social factors
… But at a deeper level for me, it doesn’t look at basic human processes.” One reason why
is that it is “much more politically challenging”25 to say that so many people are feeling
terrible because of how our societies now work. It fits much more with our system of
“neoliberal capitalism,” he told me, to say, “Okay, we’ll get you functioning more
efficiently, but please don’t start questioning … because that’s going to destabilize all
sorts of things.” This observation fits, he believes, with the other big key reason. “The
pharmaceutical [companies] are major forces shaping a lot of psychiatry, because it’s this
big, big business—billions of dollars,” he said. They pay the bills, so they largely set
the agenda, and they obviously want our pain to be seen as a chemical problem with a
chemical solution. The result is that we have ended up, as a culture, with a distorted
sense of our own distress. He looked at me. The fact that “the entire program of
psychiatric research should look like [this],” he said, “is really disturbing.”
#+end_quote

- Psychiatry evolution: Shift towards a more biological perspective on mental health.
- Critique of oversimplification: Lack of consideration for social and human processes in
  understanding depression.
- Political challenges: Reluctance to attribute widespread distress to societal factors
  due to potential disruptions in the existing system.
- Influence of pharmaceutical companies: Significant role in shaping psychiatric practices
  and promoting a chemical-centric approach to mental health.
- Distorted cultural perception: Results in an incomplete understanding and treatment of
  mental distress.
- Concerning state of psychiatric research: Emphasis on chemical solutions raises concerns
  about the broader approach to mental health.
