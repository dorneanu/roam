* Information as connection vs. representation

Information's primary function is to *create networks and connections* rather than merely
represent reality. This fundamental insight challenges traditional views of information as
truth-seeking.

Key Quote (p. 35):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What the example of astrology illustrates is that errors, lies, fantasies, and fictions
are information, too. Contrary to what the *naive view* of information says, information has
no essential link to truth, and its role in history isn't to represent a preexisting
reality. Rather, *what information does is to create new realities by tying together
disparate things* â€”whether couples or empires. Its defining feature is connection rather
than representation, and information is whatever connects different points into a network.
*Information doesn't necessarily inform us about things. Rather, it puts things in
formation*. Horoscopes put lovers in astrological formations, propaganda broadcasts put
voters in political formations, and marching songs put soldiers in military formations.
#+END_QUOTE

Harari argues that information's power lies not in its accuracy but in its ability to
forge human networks. Even false information can be highly effective at creating social
formations.

Supporting Evidence (p. 37):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Let us pause to digest the implications of this. Information is something that creates new
realities by connecting different points into a network. This still includes the view of
information as representation. Sometimes, a truthful representation of reality can connect
humans, as when 600 million people sat glued to their television sets in July 1969,
watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon. The images on the screens
accurately represented what was happening 384,000 kilometers away, and seeing them gave
rise to feelings of awe, pride, and human brotherliness that helped connect people.
#+END_QUOTE

Final Principle (p. 39):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To conclude, *information sometimes represents reality, and sometimes doesn't. But it
always connects*. This is its fundamental characteristic. Therefore, when examining the
role of information in history, although it sometimes makes sense to ask 'How well does it
represent reality? Is it true or false?' *often the more crucial questions are 'How well
does it connect people? What new network does it create?'*
#+END_QUOTE

Naive View Critique (p. 34):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If all information is an attempt to represent reality, then as the amount of information
in the world grows, we can expect the flood of information to expose the occasional lies
and errors and to ultimately provide us with a more truthful understanding of the world.
#+END_QUOTE
* AI as unprecedented technology
AI represents the first technology capable of making autonomous decisions and creating
ideas independently of human control.

Key Quote (p. 17):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Given the magnitude of the danger, AI should be of interest to all human beings. While not
everyone can become an AI expert, *we should all keep in mind that AI is the first
technology in history that can make decisions and create new ideas by itself*. All previous
human inventions have empowered humans, because no matter how powerful the new tool was,
the decisions about its usage remained in our hands. *Knives and bombs do not themselves
decide whom to kill. They are dumb tools, lacking the intelligence necessary to process
information and make independent decisions. In contrast, AI can process information by
itself, and thereby replace humans in decision making. AI isn't a tool*â€”it's an agent.
#+END_QUOTE

This distinction between tools and agents marks a fundamental shift in human-technology
relations. Previous technologies extended human capabilities while keeping humans in
control of decisions.

Alien intelligence concept (p. 208):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Traditionally, AI has been an abbreviation for 'artificial intelligence.' But for reasons
already evident from the previous discussion, it is perhaps better to think of it as
'alien intelligence.' *As AI evolves, it becomes less artificial (in the sense of
depending on human designs) and more alien. It should also be noted that people often
define and evaluate AI through the metric of 'human-level intelligence,'* and there is
much debate about when we can expect AIs to reach 'human-level intelligence.' The use of
this metric, however, is deeply confusing. It is like defining and evaluating airplanes
through the metric of 'bird-level flight.' *AI isn't progressing toward human-level
intelligence*. It is evolving an entirely different type of intelligence.
#+END_QUOTE

Historical magnitude (p. 360):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The invention of AI is potentially more momentous than the invention of the telegraph, the
printing press, or even writing, because AI is the first technology that is capable of
making decisions and generating ideas by itself.
#+END_QUOTE

Intelligence vs. Consciousness (p. 194):

#+BEGIN_- *Intelligence*
  - Ability to attain goals
  - Example: maximizing user engagement on a social media platform
  - Can exist without consciousness

- *Consciousness*  
  - Ability to experience subjective feelings
  - Examples: pain, pleasure, love, hate
  - About internal subjective experience
    
#+begin_quote
People often confuse intelligence with consciousness, and many consequently jump to the
conclusion that nonconscious entities cannot be intelligent. But intelligence and
consciousness are very different. Intelligence is the ability to attain goals, such as
maximizing user engagement on a social media platform. Consciousness is the ability to
experience subjective feelings like pain, pleasure, love, and hate. In humans and other
mammals, intelligence often goes hand in hand with consciousness. Facebook executives and
engineers rely on their feelings in order to make decisions, solve problems, and attain
their goals.
#+END_QUOTE



Unfathomability (p. 304):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Second, move 37 demonstrated the unfathomability of AI. Even after AlphaGo played it to
achieve victory, Suleyman and his team couldn't explain how AlphaGo decided to play it.
Even if a court had ordered DeepMind to provide Lee Sedol with an explanation, nobody
could fulfill that order. Suleyman writes, 'Us humans face a novel challenge: will new
inventions be beyond our grasp? Previously creators could explain how something worked,
why it did what it did, even if this required vast detail. That's increasingly no longer
true. Many technologies and systems are becoming so complex that they're beyond the
capacity of any one individual to truly understand themâ€¦. In AI, the neural networks
moving toward autonomy are, at present, not explainable. You can't walk someone through
the decision-making process to explain precisely why an algorithm produced a specific
prediction. Engineers can't peer beneath the hood and easily explain in granular detail
what caused something to happen. GPT-4, AlphaGo, and the rest are black boxes, their
outputs and decisions based on opaque and impossibly intricate chains of minute signals.'
#+END_QUOTE

* Information networks and social reality

Human societies operate on *three levels* of reality: objective, subjective, and crucially,
intersubjective reality created through shared stories.

Key Quote (p. 46):

- *Objective reality*
  - Physical things that exist independently of human awareness (stones, mountains,
    asteroids)
- *Subjective reality*
  - Mental experiences that exist only within individual consciousness (pain, pleasure,
    love)
- *Intersubjective reality*
  - Concepts that exist through shared stories and collective belief (laws, gods, nations,
    corporations, money)
    
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The two levels of reality that preceded storytelling are objective reality and subjective
reality. Objective reality consists of things like stones, mountains, and asteroidsâ€”things
that exist whether we are aware of them or not. An asteroid hurtling toward planet Earth,
for example, exists even if nobody knows it's out there. Then there is subjective reality:
things like pain, pleasure, and love that aren't 'out there' but rather 'in here.'
Subjective things exist in our awareness of them. An unfelt ache is an oxymoron. But some
stories are able to create a third level of reality: intersubjective reality. Whereas
subjective things like pain exist in a single mind, intersubjective things like laws,
gods, nations, corporations, and currencies exist in the nexus between large numbers of
minds. More specifically, they exist in the stories people tell one another. The
information humans exchange about intersubjective things doesn't represent anything that
had already existed prior to the exchange of information; rather, the exchange of
information creates these things.
#+END_QUOTE

This three-level framework explains how human cooperation scales beyond personal
relationships through shared narratives that create binding social realities.

Practical application (p. 48):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Disagreements about the existence of states cannot be resolved by an objective test, such
as a DNA survey or a sonar scan. Unlike animals, states are not an objective reality. *When
we ask whether a particular state exists, we are raising a question about intersubjective
reality. If enough people agree that a particular state exists, then it does*. It can then
do things like sign legally binding agreements with other states as well as NGOs and
private corporations.
#+END_QUOTE

Human cooperation (p. 41):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*We Sapiens rule the world not because we are so wise but because we are the only animals
that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers*
#+END_QUOTE

Story networks (p. 41):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Instead of building a network from human-to-human chains aloneâ€”as the Neanderthals, for
example, did â€” stories provided Homo sapiens with a new type of chain: human-to-story
chains. *In order to cooperate, Sapiens no longer had to know each other personally; they
just had to know the same story. And the same story can be familiar to billions of
individuals. A story can thereby serve like a central connector, with an unlimited number
of outlets into which an unlimited number of people can plug*.
#+END_QUOTE

Ideological power (p. 53):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you build a bomb and ignore the facts of physics, the bomb will not explode. *But if you
build an ideology and ignore the facts, the ideology may still prove explosive*.
#+END_QUOTE

Evolutionary adaptation (p. 62):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Evolution has adapted our brains to be good at absorbing, retaining, and processing even
very large quantities of information when they are shaped into a story.
#+END_QUOTE
* Populism and Information Warfare

Information as Weapon Populist movements view information primarily as a tool for power
rather than truth-seeking, undermining democratic discourse.


Key Quote (p. 19):

- *Core populist claims:*
  - Institutions (media, academia, government) deliberately spread disinformation for power
  - These elites don't seek truth but only self-interest at "the people's" expense

- *Information as weapon:*
  - Extreme populism rejects objective truth entirely
  - Everyone has "their own truth" used to defeat opponents
  - Power becomes the only reality; all interactions are power struggles
  - Claims about truth/justice are just power plays

*Consequences:*
  - Language itself breaks down
  - Words like "facts," "accurate," and "truthful" lose shared meaning
  - Any truth claim prompts the question: "Whose truth?"
  
#+begin_QUOTE
gather information and discover truth are simply lying. Bureaucrats, judges, doctors,
mainstream journalists, and academic experts are elite cabals that have no interest in the
truth and are deliberately spreading disinformation to gain power and privileges for
themselves at the expense of "the people." The rise of politicians like Trump and
movements like QAnon has a specific political context, unique to the conditions of the
United States in the late 2010s. But populism as an antiestablishment worldview long
predated Trump and is relevant to numerous other historical contexts now and in the
future. In a nutshell, populism views information as a weapon. The populist view of
information In its more extreme versions, populism posits that there is no objective truth
at all and that everyone has "their own truth," which they wield to vanquish rivals.
According to this worldview, power is the only reality. All social interactions are power
struggles, because humans are interested only in power. The claim to be interested in
something elseâ€”like truth or justiceâ€”is nothing more than a ploy to gain power. Whenever
and wherever populism succeeds in disseminating the view of information as a weapon,
language itself is undermined. Nouns like "facts" and adjectives like "accurate" and
"truthful" become elusive. Such words are not taken as pointing to a common objective
reality. Rather, any talk of "facts" or "truth" is bound to prompt at least some people to
ask, "Whose facts and whose truth are you referring to?"
#+END_QUOTE


This weaponization of information creates a crisis of trust in institutions and shared
reality, making democratic consensus increasingly difficult.

Binary worldview (p. 20):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*This binary interpretation of history implies that every human interaction is a power
struggle between oppressors and oppressed. Accordingly, whenever anyone says anything,
the question to ask isn't, "What is being said? Is it true?" but rather, "Who is saying
this? Whose privileges does it serve?"*
#+END_QUOTE

Balanced view (p. 23):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If we wish to avoid relinquishing power to a charismatic leader or an inscrutable AI, we
must first gain a better understanding of *what information is*, how it helps to build
human networks, *and how it relates to truth and power*. *Populists are right to be
suspicious of the naive view of information, but they are wrong to think that power is
the only reality and that information is always a weapon. Information isn't the raw
material of truth, but it isn't a mere weapon, either*. There is enough space between
these extremes for a more nuanced and hopeful view of human information networks and of
our ability to handle power wisely.
#+END_QUOTE

Mystical people (p. 136):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A fundamental part of this populist credo is the belief that "the people" is not a
collection of flesh-and-blood individuals with various interests and opinions, but
rather a unified mystical body that possesses a single willâ€”"the will of the people."
Perhaps the most notorious and extreme manifestation of this semireligious belief was
the Nazi motto "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein FÃ¼hrer," which means "One People, One Country,
One Leader." *Nazi ideology posited that the Volk (people) had a single will*, whose sole
authentic representative was the FÃ¼hrer (leader)
#+END_QUOTE

Populist definition (p. 136):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The term "populism" derives from the Latin populus, which means "the people." In
democracies, *"the people" is considered the sole legitimate source of political
authority*. *Only representatives of the people should have the authority to declare wars,
pass laws, and raise taxes*. Populists cherish this basic democratic principle, but
somehow conclude from it that a single party or a single leader should monopolize all
power. In a curious political alchemy, populists manage to base a totalitarian pursuit
of unlimited power on a seemingly impeccable democratic principle.
#+END_QUOTE

Elite opposition (p. 137):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*However, many populist parties and politicians deny that "the people" might contain a
diversity of opinions and interest groups. They insist that the real people has only one
will and that they alone represent this will. In contrast, their political rivalsâ€”even
when the latter enjoy substantial popular supportâ€”are depicted as "alien elites."*
#+END_QUOTE

Authority monopoly (p. 138):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Populism undermines democracy in another, more subtle, but equally dangerous way. Having
claimed that they alone represent the people, *populists argue that the people is not
just the sole legitimate source of political authority but the sole legitimate source of
all authority*. *Any institution that derives its authority from something other than the
will of the people is antidemocratic*. As the self-proclaimed representatives of the
people, populists consequently seek to monopolize not just political authority but all
types of authority and to take control of institutions such as media outlets, courts,
and universities. By taking the democratic principle of "people's power" to its extreme,
populists turn totalitarian.
#+END_QUOTE

Simplification appeal (p. 139):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In all, it's a rather sordid view of humanity, but two things nevertheless make it
appealing to many. First, since it reduces all interactions to power struggles, it
simplifies reality and makes events like wars, economic crises, and natural disasters
easy to understand. *Anything that happensâ€”even a pandemicâ€”is about elites pursuing
power. Second, the populist view is attractive because it is sometimes correct*. *Every
human institution is indeed fallible and suffers from some level of corruption*. Some
judges do take bribes. Some journalists do intentionally mislead the public. Academic
disciplines are occasionally plagued by bias and nepotism. That is why every institution
needs self-correcting mechanisms. But since populists are convinced that power is the
only reality, they cannot accept that a court, a media outlet, or an academic discipline
would ever be inspired by the value of truth or justice to correct itself.
#+END_QUOTE

* Democratic Principles and Challenges

- Democracy vs. Populism Democracy requires complex institutional checks rather than
  simple majority rule, distinguishing it from populist conceptions of "the will of the
  people."

- Key Quote (p. 128):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Of course, if the central government doesn't intervene at all in people's lives, and
  doesn't provide them with basic services like security, it isn't a democracy; it is
  anarchy. In all democracies the center raises taxes and maintains an army, and in most
  modern democracies it also provides at least some level of health care, education, and
  welfare. But any intervention in people's lives demands an explanation. In the absence
  of a compelling reason, a democratic government should leave people to their own
  devices.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Analysis True democracy balances central authority with individual freedom through
  institutional safeguards and self-correcting mechanisms.

- Fallibility Principle (p. 129):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Another crucial characteristic of democracies is that they assume everyone is fallible.
  Therefore, while democracies give the center the authority to make some vital decisions,
  they also maintain strong mechanisms that can challenge the central authority. To
  paraphrase President James Madison, since humans are fallible, a government is
  necessary, but since government too is fallible, it needs mechanisms to expose and
  correct its errors, such as holding regular elections, protecting the freedom of the
  press, and separating the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Strongman Tactics (p. 130):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Of course, most assaults on democracy are more subtle. The careers of strongmen like
  Vladimir Putin, Viktor OrbÃ¡n, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, Rodrigo Duterte, Jair Bolsonaro, and
  Benjamin Netanyahu demonstrate how a leader who uses democracy to rise to power can then
  use his power to undermine democracy. As ErdoÄŸan once put it, "Democracy is like a tram.
  You ride it until you arrive at your destination, then you step off."
  #+END_QUOTE

- Genocide Example (p. 130):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Suppose that in a free and fair election 51 percent of voters choose a government that
  subsequently sends 1 percent of voters to be exterminated in death camps, because they
  belong to some hated religious minority. Is this democratic? Clearly it is not. The
  problem isn't that genocide demands a special majority of more than 51 percent. It's not
  that if the government gets the backing of 60 percent, 75 percent, or even 99 percent of
  voters, then its death camps finally become democratic. A democracy is not a system in
  which a majority of any size can decide to exterminate unpopular minorities; it is a
  system in which there are clear limits on the power of the center.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Rights Baskets (p. 131):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  But in a democracy, there are two baskets of rights that are protected from the
  majority's grasp. One contains human rights. Even if 99 percent of the population wants
  to exterminate the remaining 1 percent, in a democracy this is forbidden, because it
  violates the most basic human rightâ€”the right to life. The basket of human rights
  contains many additional rights, such as the right to work, the right to privacy,
  freedom of movement, and freedom of religion. These rights enshrine the decentralized
  nature of democracy, making sure that as long as people don't harm anyone, they can live
  their lives as they see fit. The second crucial basket of rights contains civil rights.
  These are the basic rules of the democratic game, which enshrine its self-correcting
  mechanisms. An obvious example is the right to vote. If the majority were permitted to
  disenfranchise the minority, then democracy would be over after a single election. Other
  civil rights include freedom of the press, academic freedom, and freedom of assembly,
  which enable independent media outlets, universities, and opposition movements to
  challenge the government. These are the key rights that strongmen seek to violate.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Core Definition (p. 131):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  However, democracy doesn't mean majority rule; rather, it means freedom and equality for
  all. Democracy is a system that guarantees everyone certain liberties, which even the
  majority cannot take away.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Elections and Truth (p. 133):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It is particularly crucial to remember that elections are not a method for discovering
  truth. Rather, they are a method for maintaining order by adjudicating between people's
  conflicting desires. Elections establish what the majority of people desire, rather than
  what the truth is. And people often desire the truth to be other than what it is.
  Democratic networks therefore maintain some self-correcting mechanisms to protect the
  truth even from the will of the majority.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Complexity Requirement (p. 135):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If all this sounds complicated, it is because democracy should be complicated.
  Simplicity is a characteristic of dictatorial information networks in which the center
  dictates everything and everybody silently obeys. It's easy to follow this dictatorial
  monologue. In contrast, democracy is a conversation with numerous participants, many of
  them talking at the same time. It can be hard to follow such a conversation.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Scale Problems (p. 145):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The key misconception here is equating democracy with elections. Tens of millions of
  Roman citizens could theoretically vote for this or that imperial candidate. But the
  real question is whether tens of millions of Romans could have held an ongoing
  empire-wide political conversation. In present-day North Korea no democratic
  conversation takes place because people aren't free to talk, yet we could well imagine a
  situation when this freedom is guaranteedâ€”as it is in South Korea. In the present-day
  United States the democratic conversation is endangered by people's inability to listen
  to and respect their political rivals, yet this can presumably still be fixed. By
  contrast, in the Roman Empire there was simply no way to conduct or sustain a democratic
  conversation, because the technological means to hold such a conversation did not exist.
  #+END_QUOTE

- Network Changes (p. 311):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Before the advent of newspapers, radios, and other modern information technology, no
  large-scale society managed to combine free debates with institutional trust, so
  large-scale democracy was impossible. Now, with the rise of the new computer network,
  might large-scale democracy again become impossible? One difficulty is that the computer
  network makes it easier to join the debate. In the past, organizations like newspapers,
  radio stations, and established political parties acted as gatekeepers, deciding who was
  heard in the public sphere. Social media undermined the power of these gatekeepers,
  leading to a more open but also more anarchical public conversation. Whenever new groups
  join the conversation, they bring with them new viewpoints and interests, and often
  question the old consensus about how to conduct the debate and reach decisions. The
  rules of discussion must be negotiated anew. This is a potentially positive development,
  one that can lead to a more inclusive democratic system. After all, correcting previous
  biases and allowing previously disenfranchised people to join the public discussion is a
  vital part of democracy. However, in the short term this creates disturbances and
  disharmony. If no agreement is reached on how to conduct the public debate and how to
  reach decisions, the result is anarchy rather than democracy.
  #+END_QUOTE

- AI Manipulation (p. 312):
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If I engage online in a political debate with an AI, it is a waste of time for me to try
  to change the AI's opinions; being a nonconscious entity, it doesn't really care about
  politics, and it cannot vote in the elections. But the more I talk with the AI, the
  better it gets to know me, so it can gain my trust, hone its arguments, and gradually
  change my views. In the battle for hearts and minds, intimacy is an extremely powerful
  weapon. Previously, political parties could command our attention, but they had
  difficulty mass-producing intimacy. Radio sets could broadcast a leader's speech to
  millions, but they could not befriend the listeners. Now a political party, or even a
  foreign government, could deploy an army of bots that build friendships with millions of
  citizens and then use that intimacy to influence their worldview.
  #+END_QUOTE
* Totalitarian Information Control

** Centralized vs. Distributed Networks
Totalitarian systems concentrate information flow through central hubs, while democratic systems encourage distributed information processing.

** Key Quote (p. 174):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We see then that the new information technology of the late modern era gave rise to both large-scale democracy and large-scale totalitarianism. But there were crucial differences between how the two systems used information technology. As noted earlier, democracy encourages information to flow through many independent channels rather than only through the center, and it allows many independent nodes to process the information and make decisions by themselves. Information freely circulates between private businesses, private media organizations, municipalities, sports associations, charities, families, and individualsâ€”without ever passing through the office of a government minister. In contrast, totalitarianism wants all information to pass through the central hub and doesn't want any independent institutions making decisions on their own. True, totalitarianism does have its tripartite apparatus of government, party, and secret police. But the whole point of this parallel apparatus is to prevent the emergence of any independent power that might challenge the center. When government officials, party members, and secret police agents constantly keep tabs on one another, opposing the center is extremely dangerous.
#+END_QUOTE

** Analysis
The structure of information networks - centralized or distributed - fundamentally shapes political systems and individual freedoms.

** Chernobyl Example (p. 175):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For example, when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded on April 26, 1986, Soviet authorities suppressed all news of the disaster. Both Soviet citizens and foreign countries were kept oblivious of the danger, and so took no steps to protect themselves from radiation. When some Soviet officials in Chernobyl and the nearby town of Pripyat requested to immediately evacuate nearby population centers, their superiors' chief concern was to avoid the spread of alarming news, so they not only forbade evacuation but also cut the phone lines and warned employees in the nuclear facility not to talk about the disaster.
#+END_QUOTE

** Questions and Trouble (p. 176):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In 2019, I went on a tour of Chernobyl. The Ukrainian guide who explained what led to the nuclear accident said something that stuck in my mind. 'Americans grow up with the idea that questions lead to answers,' he said. 'But Soviet citizens grew up with the idea that questions lead to trouble.'
#+END_QUOTE

** Soviet Kulak Campaign (p. 167):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When their efforts to collectivize farming encountered resistance and led to economic disaster, Moscow bureaucrats and mythmakers took a page from Kramer's Hammer of the Witches. I don't wish to imply that the Soviets actually read the book, but they too invented a global conspiracy and created an entire nonexistent category of enemies. In the 1930s Soviet authorities repeatedly blamed the disasters afflicting the Soviet economy on a counterrevolutionary cabal whose chief agents were the 'kulaks,' or capitalist farmers. Just as in Kramer's imagination witches serving Satan conjured hailstorms that destroyed crops, so in the Stalinist imagination kulaks beholden to global capitalism sabotaged the Soviet economy.
#+END_QUOTE

** Kulak Identification (p. 168):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
How exactly did Soviet officials tell who was a kulak? In some villages, local party members made a conscientious effort to identify kulaks by objective measures, such as the amount of property they owned. It was often the most hardworking and efficient farmers who were stigmatized and expelled. In some villages local communists used the opportunity to get rid of their personal enemies. Some villages simply drew lots on who would be considered a kulak. Other villages held communal meetings to vote on the matter and often chose isolated farmers, widows, old people, and other 'expendables' (exactly the sorts of people who in early modern Europe were most likely to be branded witches)
#+END_QUOTE

** Intersubjective Labels (p. 170):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Like the ten-year-old 'witch' Hansel Pappenheimer, the eleven-year-old 'kulak' Antonina Golovina found herself cast into an intersubjective category invented by human mythmakers and imposed by ubiquitous bureaucrats. The mountains of information collected by Soviet bureaucrats about the kulaks wasn't the objective truth about them, but it imposed a new intersubjective Soviet truth. Knowing that someone was labeled a kulak was a very important thing to know about a Soviet person, even though the label was entirely bogus.
#+END_QUOTE

** Family Control Joke (p. 171):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Soviet attempt to control the family was reflected in a dark joke told in Stalin's day. Stalin visits a factory undercover, and conversing with a worker, he asks the man, 'Who is your father?' 'Stalin,' replies the worker. 'Who is your mother?' 'The Soviet Union,' the man responds. 'And what do you want to be?' 'An orphan.' At the time you could easily lose your liberty or your life for telling this joke, even if you told it in your own home to your closest family members.
#+END_QUOTE

** Revolutionary Parties (p. 173):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Unlike premodern churches, which developed slowly over many centuries and therefore tended to be conservative and suspicious of rapid changes, modern totalitarian parties like the Nazi Party and the Soviet Communist Party were organized within a single generation around the promise to quickly revolutionize society. They didn't have centuries-old traditions and structures to defend. When their leaders conceived some ambitious plan to smash existing traditions and structures, party members typically fell in line.
#+END_QUOTE

** Stalin's Death (p. 180):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In 1951â€“53 the U.S.S.R. experienced yet another witch hunt. Soviet mythmakers fabricated a conspiracy theory that Jewish doctors were systematically murdering leading regime members, under the guise of giving them medical care. The theory alleged that the doctors were the agents of a global American-Zionist plot, working in collaboration with traitors in the secret police. By early 1953 hundreds of doctors and secret police officials, including the head of the secret police himself, were arrested, tortured, and forced to name accomplices. The conspiracy theoryâ€”a Soviet twist on the Protocols of the Elders of Zionâ€”merged with age-old blood-libel accusations, and rumors began circulating that Jewish doctors were not just murdering Soviet leaders but also killing babies in hospitals. Since a large proportion of Soviet doctors were Jews, people began fearing doctors in general. Just as the hysteria about 'the doctors' plot' was reaching its climax, Stalin had a stroke on March 1, 1953. He collapsed in his dacha, wet himself, and lay for hours in his soiled pajamas, unable to call for help. At around 10:30 p.m. a guard found the courage to enter the inner sanctum of world communism, where he discovered the leader on the floor. By 3:00 a.m. on March 2, Politburo members arrived at the dacha and debated what to do. For several hours more, nobody dared call a doctor. What if Stalin were to regain consciousness, and open his eyes only to see a doctorâ€”a doctor!â€”hovering over his bed? He would surely think this was a plot to murder him and would have those responsible shot. Stalin's personal physician wasn't present, because he was at the time in a basement cell of the Lubyanka prisonâ€”undergoing torture for suggesting that Stalin needed more rest. By the time the Politburo members decided to bring in medical experts, the danger had passed. Stalin never woke up.
