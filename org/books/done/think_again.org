Research shows that when people are resistant to change, it helps to reinforce what will stay the same. Visions for change are more compel- ling when they include visions of continuity. Although our strategy might evolve, our identity will endure.

My past self was Mr. Facts-I was too fixated on knowing. Now I'm more interested in finding out what I don't know. As Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told me, "If you don't look back at yourself and think, 'Wow, how stupid I was a year ago, then you must not have learned much in the last year."

The second kind of detachment is separating your opinions from your identity. I'm guessing you wouldn't want to see a doctor whose iden- tity is Professional Lobotomist, send your kids to a teacher whose identity is Corporal Punisher, or live in a town where the police chief's identity is Stop-and-Frisker. Once upon a time, all of these practices were seen as reasonable and effective

If we're insecure, we make fun of others. If we're comfortable being wrong, we're not afraid to poke fun at ourselves. Laughing at ourselves reminds us that although we might take our decisions seriously, we don't have to take ourselves too seriously. Research suggests that the more fre. quently we make fun of ourselves, the happier we tend to be.* Instead of beating ourselves up about our mistakes, we can turn some of our past misconceptions into sources of present amusement

Relationship conflict vs task conflict

Relationship Conflict refers to personal, interpersonal disagreements among team members, often rooted in personal animosity, jealousy, or other emotional issues. Such conflicts are characterized by a focus on individuals' characteristics rather than the task at hand, leading to a toxic work environment, reduced team cohesion, and impaired group performance. Grant emphasizes the detrimental effects of relationship conflicts on team collaboration and productivity, suggesting that they should be minimized or resolved to maintain a healthy workplace.

Task Conflict, on the other hand, involves disagreements about the work itself, such as differences in opinions, ideas, and approaches to achieving a common goal. Unlike relationship conflicts, task conflicts can be beneficial to teams when managed properly. They encourage diverse thinking, creativity, and reevaluation of ideas, contributing to better decision-making and innovation. Grant advocates for embracing task conflicts in a constructive manner, fostering an environment where dissenting opinions are valued and explored rather than suppressed.

**** Note 1

#+begin_quote
A good debate is not a war. It's not even a tug-of-war, where you can drag your opponent to your side if you pull hard enough on the rope. It's more like a dance that hasn't been choreographed, negotiated with a par ner who has a different set of steps in mind. If you try too hard to lead. your partner will resist. If you can adapt your moves to hers, and get her to do the same, you're more likely to end up in rhythm

**** On to many strong arguments

#+begin_quote
As the negotiators started discussing options and making proposals, a second difference emerged. Most people think of arguments as being like a pair of scales: the more reasons we can pile up on our side, the more it will tip the balance in our favor. Yet the experts did the exact opposite: They actually presented fewer reasons to support their case. They didn't want to water down their best points. As Rackham put it, "A weak argu- ment generally dilutes a strong one."

**** Skilled vs average negotiators                                    :TODO:

Cognitive Flexibility: Skilled negotiators possess a high degree of cognitive flexibility, allowing them to reconsider their positions, adapt their strategies in real-time, and entertain multiple perspectives. This contrasts with average negotiators, who may become anchored to their initial positions and fail to adjust to new information or changing circumstances.Empathy and Perspective-Taking: Grant highlights the importance of empathy in negotiation, where skilled negotiators excel in understanding and valuing the perspectives of their counterparts. They actively listen and engage in perspective-taking, which enables them to uncover underlying interests and find common ground. Average negotiators, on the other hand, may focus predominantly on their own needs and positions, overlooking the interests of the other party.Constructive Disagreement: Skilled negotiators view disagreements as opportunities for problem-solving rather than conflicts to be won. They approach negotiations with a collaborative mindset, seeking solutions that satisfy both parties' core interests. This is in contrast to average negotiators who might approach negotiations as zero-sum games, where one party's gain is seen as the other's loss.Questioning and Rethinking Assumptions: Skilled negotiators are adept at questioning assumptions, both their own and those of others. They use probing questions to explore and uncover assumptions that may be driving the negotiation. This openness to rethinking enables them to identify creative solutions that might not be apparent to someone who is unwilling to challenge their initial assumptions.Preparation and Strategy: While not unique to skilled negotiators, the depth and breadth of their preparation set them apart. They invest time in understanding the context, the parties involved, and potential negotiation dynamics. This thorough preparation, combined with their cognitive and emotional skills, allows them to navigate negotiations more effectively.

**** Motivational interviewing

Empathetic Engagement: Grant emphasizes the importance of empathetic engagement, where the interviewer expresses genuine interest and understanding of the interviewee's perspective without judgment.Open-ended Questions: He advocates for the use of open-ended questions to encourage deeper reflection and discussion, allowing individuals to explore their thoughts and feelings more fully.Reflective Listening: Grant highlights reflective listening as a key technique, where the interviewer mirrors back what the interviewee has said, demonstrating understanding and encouraging further elaboration.Affirmation: He notes the significance of affirmation, where positive reinforcement is used to acknowledge the interviewee's strengths, efforts, and progress, fostering a supportive and encouraging environment.Eliciting Change Talk: Grant discusses the strategy of eliciting 'change talk' from the interviewee, encouraging them to verbalize their own motivations for change, which can be more persuasive than external arguments.Respecting Autonomy: He underscores the importance of respecting the interviewee's autonomy, making it clear that any decisions and changes are ultimately up to them, which can enhance their motivation to change.

Creating communities of lifelong learners
*** Charged conversations: Depolarizing our divided discussions
**** Binary bias

#+begin_quote
Psychologists have a name for this: binary bias. It's a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum into two categories. To paraphrase the humorist Robert Benchley, there are two kinds of people: those who divide the world into two kinds of people, and those who don't.

An antidote to this proclivity is complexifying: showcasing the range of perspectives on a given topic. We might believe we're making progress by discussing hot-button issues as two sides of a coin, but people are actually more inclined to think again if we present these topics through the many lenses of a prism. To borrow a phrase from Walt Whitman, it takes a multitude of views to help people realize that they too contain multitudes.

**** Skeptics vs deniers

#+begin_quote
It's especially important to distinguish skeptics from deniers. Skep- tics have a healthy scientific stance: They don't believe everything they see, hear, or read. They ask critical questions and update their think ing as they gain access to new information. Deniers are in the dismis sive camp, locked in preacher, prosecutor, or politician mode: They don't believe anything that comes from the other side. They ignore or twist facts to support their predetermined conclusions. As the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry put it in a plea to the media, skepticism is "foundationalto the scientific method," whereas denial is "the a priori rejection of ideas without objective consideration,"*

*Climatologists go further, noting that within denial there are at least six different categories: arguing that (1) COa is not increasing. (2) even if CO2 is increasing, warming is not happening: (3) even if warming is happening, it's due to natural causes; (4) even if humans are causing warming, the impact is minimal; (5) even if the human impact is not trivial, it will be beneficial; and (6) before the situation becomes truly dire, we'll adapt or solve it. Experiments suggest that giving science deniers a public platform can backfire by spreading false beliefs, but rebutting their arguments or their techniques can help.

A. Develop the Habit of Thinking Again

1. Think like a scientist. When you start forming an opinion, resist the temptation to preach, prosecute, or politick. Treat your emerging view as a hunch or a hypothesis and test it with data. Like the entrepreneurs who learned to approach their business strategies as experiments, you'll main- tain the agility to pivot.

2. Define your identity in terms of values, not opinions. It's easier to avoid getting stuck to your past beliefs if you don't become attached to them as part of your present self-concept. See yourself as someone who val- ues curiosity, learning, mental flexibility, and searching for knowledge.As you form opinions, keep a list of factors that would change your mind.

3. Seek out information that goes against your views. You can fight confirma tion bias, burst filter bubbles, and escape echo chambers by actively en- gaging with ideas that challenge your assumptions. An easy place to start is to follow people who make you think-even if you usually disagree with what they think.

B. Calibrate Your Confidence

4. Beware of getting stranded at the summit of Mount Stupid, Don't confuse confidence with competence. The Dunning-Kruger effect is a good re minder that the better you think you are, the greater the risk that you're overestimating yourself and the greater the odds that you'll stop im proving. To prevent overconfidence in your knowledge, reflect on how well you can explain a given subject.

5. Harness the benefits of doubt. When you find yourself doubting your ability, reframe the situation as an opportunity for growth. You can have confidence in your capacity to learn while questioning your current solu- tion to a problem. Knowing what you don't know is often the first step toward developing expertise.

6. Embrace the joy of being wrong. When you find out you've made a mis- take, take it as a sign that you've just discovered something new. Don't be afraid to laugh at yourself. It helps you focus less on proving yourself- and more on improving yourself.

C. Invite Others to Question Your Thinking

7. Learn something new from each person you meet. Everyone knows more than you about something. Ask people what they've been rethinking lately. or start a conversation about times you've changed your mind in the past year.

8. Build a challenge network, not just a support network. It's helpful to have cheerleaders encouraging you, but you also need critics to challenge you. Who are your most thoughtful critics? Once you've identified them, in- vite them to question your thinking. To make sure they know you're open to dissenting views, tell them why you respect their pushback-and where they usually add the most value.

9. Don't shy away from constructive conflict. Disagreements don't have to be disagreeable. Although relationship conflict is usually counterpro- ductive, task conflict can help you think again. Try framing disagree- ment as a debate: people are more likely to approach it intellectually and less likely to take it personally.

*** Interpersonal Thinking

A. Ask Better Questions

10. Practice the art of persuasive listening. When we're trying to open other people's minds, we can frequently accomplish more by listening than by talking. How can you show an interest in helping people crystallize their own views and uncover their own reasons for change? A good way to start is to increase your question-to-statement ratio.
11. Question how rather than why. When people describe why they hold extreme views, they often intensify their commitment and double down. When they try to explain how they would make their views a reality, they often realize the limits of their understanding and start to temper some of their opinions.

12. Ask "What evidence would change your mind?" You can't bully someone into agreeing with you. It's often more effective to inquire about what would open their minds, and then see if you can convince them on their own terms.

13. Ask how people originally formed an opinion. Many of our opinions, like our stereotypes, are arbitrary, we've developed them without rigorous data or deep reflection. To help people reevaluate, prompt them to consider how they'd believe different things if they'd been born at a different time or in a different place.

B. Approach Disagreements as Dances, Not Battles

14. Acknowledge common ground. A debate is like a dance, not a war. Ad- mitting points of convergence doesn't make you weaker-it shows that you're willing to negotiate about what's true, and it motivates the other side to consider your point of view.

15. Remember that less is often more. If you pile on too many different reasons to support your case, it can make your audiences defensive-and cause them to reject your entire argument based on its least compelling points. Instead of diluting your argument, lead with a few of your strongest points

16. Reinforce freedom of choice. Sometimes people resist not because they're dismissing the argument but because they're rejecting the feel- ing of their behavior being controlled. It helps to respect their autonomy by reminding them that it's up to them to choose what they believe.

17. Have a conversation about the conversation. If emotions are running hot, try redirecting the discussion to the process. Like the expert nego- tiators who comment on their feelings and test their understanding of the other side's feelings, you can sometimes make progress by expressing your disappointment or frustration and asking people if they share it.

*** Collective rethinking

A. Have More Nuanced Conversations

18. Complexify contentious topics. There are more than two sides to every story. Instead of treating polarizing issues like two sides of a coin, look at them through the many lenses of a prism. Seeing the shades of gray can make us more open.

19. Don't shy away from caveats and contingencies. Acknowledging competing claims and conflicting results doesn't sacrifice interest or credibility. It's an effective way to engage audiences while encouraging them to stay curious.

20. Expand your emotional range. You don't have to eliminate frustration or even indignation to have a productive conversation. You just need to mix in a broader set of emotions along with them-you might try show- ing some curiosity or even admitting confusion or ambivalence.
B. Teach Kids to Think Again

21. Have a weekly myth-busting discussion at dinner. It's easier to debunk false beliefs at an early age, and it's a great way to teach kids to become comfortable with rethinking. Pick a different topic each week-one day it might be dinosaurs, the next it could be outer space-and rotate re sponsibility around the family for bringing a myth for discussion.

22. Invite kids to do multiple drafts and seek feedback from others. Creat ing different versions of a drawing or a story can encourage kids to learn the value of revising their ideas. Getting input from others can also help them to continue evolving their standards. They might learn to embrace confusion and to stop expecting perfection on the first try.

23. Stop asking kids what they want to be when they grow up. They don't have to define themselves in terms of a career. A single identity can close the door to alternatives. Instead of trying to narrow their options, help them broaden their possibilities. They don't have to be one thing-they can do many things.

C. Create Learning Organizations

24. Abandon best practices. Best practices suggest that the ideal routines are already in place. If we want people to keep rethinking the way they work, we might be better off adopting process accountability and con- tinually striving for better practices.

25. Establish psychological safety. In learning cultures, people feel confident that they can question and challenge the status quo without being punished. Psychological safety often starts with leaders role-modeling humility.

. Keep a rethinking scorecard. Don't evaluate decisions based only on the results; track how thoroughly different options are considered in the pro cess. A bad process with a good outcome is luck. A good process with a bad outcome might be a smart experiment.

D. Stay Open to Rethinking Your Future

27. Throw out the ten-year plan. What interested you last year might bore you this year-and what confused you yesterday might become exciting tomorrow. Passions are developed, not just discovered. Planning just one step ahead can keep you open to rethinking.

28. Rethink your actions, not just your surroundings. Chasing happiness can chase it away. Trading one set of circumstances for another isn't always enough. Joy can wax and wane, but meaning is more likely to last. Build- ing a sense of purpose often starts with taking actions to enhance your learning or your contribution to others.

29. Schedule a life checkup. It's easy to get caught in escalation of commit- ment to an unfulfilling path. Just as you schedule health checkups with your doctor, it's worth having a life checkup on your calendar once or twice a year. It's a way to assess how much you're learning, how your beliefs and goals are evolving, and whether your next steps warrant some rethinking

30. Make time to think again. When I looked at my calendar, I noticed that it was mostly full of doing. I set a goal of spending an hour a day thinking and learning. Now I've decided to go further: I'm scheduling a weekly time for rethinking and unlearning. I reach out to my challenge network and ask what ideas and opinions they think I should be reconsidering. Recently, my wife, Allison, told me that I need to rethink the way I pro- nounce the word mayonnaise.
