:END:

Although I'm using GTD for a couple of years now, I didn't have the time to read David Allen's "Gettings Things Done". Most of the diagrams and workflows you find online are scratching only at the surface of Allen's methodology.\\
\\

I'm pretty happy to have read the book entirely and extract additional concepts and tipps how to manage your life even better. For me it's definitely a strong book recommendation and I recommend it to everyone who has multiple projects to manage across different life areas. It's not only about some TODO, NEXT or DONE lists.It might take years to fully understand *and* adapt GTD to your own needs and your own life style.

The energy of your attention

A task left undone remains undone in two places---at the actual location of the task, and inside your head. Incomplete tasks in your head consume the energy of your attention as they gnaw at your conscience.
