* Page 12: Core Definition

The author defines "Slow Productivity" as a philosophy for knowledge work based on three
principles: doing fewer things, working at a natural pace, and focusing on quality.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
SLOW PRODUCTIVITY

A philosophy for organizing knowledge work efforts in a sustainable and meaningful manner,
based on the following three principles:
1. Do fewer things.
2. Work at a natural pace.
3. Obsess over quality.

* Page 30: The Broader Slow Movement

The author references Carl HonorÃ©'s book "In Praise of Slowness" and describes various
branches of the "slow movement" including Slow Cities, Slow Medicine, Slow Schooling, Slow
Media, and Slow Cinemaâ€”all advocating for a less frenetic approach to life and work.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As the journalist Carl HonorÃ© documents in his 2004 book, In Praise of Slowness, these
second-wave movements include Slow Cities, which also started in Italy (where it's called
Cittaslow), and focuses on making cities more pedestrian-centric, supportive of local
business, and, in a general sense, more neighborly. They also include Slow Medicine, which
promotes the holistic care of people as opposed to focusing only on disease, and Slow
Schooling, which attempts to free elementary school students from the pressures of
high-stakes testing and competitive tracking. More recently, the Slow Media movement has
emerged to promote more sustainable and higher-quality alternatives to digital clickbait,
and the term Slow Cinema is increasingly used to describe realistic, largely nonnarrative
movies that reward extended attention with deeper insight into the human condition. "The
slow movement was first seen as an idea for a few people who liked to eat and drink well,"
explained the mayor of Petrini's hometown of Bra. "But now it has become a much broader
cultural discussion about the benefits of doing things in a more human, less frenetic
manner."
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 35: The Goal of Slow Productivity

The author states that the goal of Slow Productivity is to create a more humane and
sustainable approach to work that becomes a source of meaning rather than overwhelm.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My goal is to offer a more humane and sustainable way to integrate professional efforts
into a life well lived. To embrace slow productivity, in other words, is to reorient your
work to be a source of meaning instead of overwhelm, while still maintaining the ability
to produce valuable output.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 42: Principle #1 - Do Fewer Things

The first principle of Slow Productivity emphasizes reducing obligations to focus more
deeply on projects that truly matter.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PRINCIPLE #1: DO FEWER THINGS

Strive to reduce your obligations to the point where you can easily imagine accomplishing
them with time to spare. Leverage this reduced load to more fully embrace and advance the
small number of projects that matter most.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 48: Knowledge Work vs. Factory Work

The author contrasts factory work with knowledge work, noting that increasing workload in
knowledge work can actually reduce both quantity and quality of output.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In a factory, pushing employees to work longer shifts might be directly more profitable.
In knowledge work, by contrast, pushing employees into larger workloads can decrease both
the quantity and quality of what they produce.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 50: Pseudo-productivity

The author acknowledges that simply recognizing the inefficiency of overwork isn't enough
to transform one's professional life because the knowledge sector still operates on
"pseudo-productivity."

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This recognition, however, is not enough on its own to support the transformation of your
professional life. The knowledge sector remains defined by the demands of
pseudo-productivity.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 56: Scheduling Reality

The author recommends a practical approach to new projects: estimate the time required and
actually schedule it on your calendar to ensure you have the capacity to take it on.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To gain this credibility, I recommend, at first, when considering a new project, you
estimate how much time it will require and then go find that time and schedule it on your
calendar. Block off the hours as you would for a meeting. If you're unable to find enough
blank spaces in your schedule in the near future to easily fit the work, then you don't
have enough time for it. Either decline the project, or cancel something else to make
room. The power of this approach is that you're dealing with the reality of your time, not
a gut feeling about how busy you are at the moment.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 57: One Project Per Day

For daily work management, the author recommends focusing on at most one significant
project per day, while still handling routine tasks and meetings.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We've arrived at the smallest scale of work that we'll consider for our limiting
strategies: the projects you decide to make progress on during the current day. My
recommendation here is simple: work on at most one project per day. To clarify, I don't
intend for this single daily project to be your only work for the day. You'll likely also
have meetings to attend, emails to answer, and administrative nonsense to subdue (we'll
talk more about these smaller tasks in the upcoming proposition about containing the
small). But when it comes to expending efforts on important, bigger initiatives, stay
focused on just one target per day.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 72: Pseudo-productivity and Parents

The author describes how pseudo-productivity particularly impacts parents (especially
mothers), creating an ongoing battle between work and family demands with no clear
boundaries.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Under a pseudo-productivity regime, by contrast, such demands are more implicit and
self-reinforced. You're judged on how much total work you visibly tackle from a
never-ending supply of available tasks, but no one is going to tell you specifically how
much is enoughâ€”that's up to you. Good luck! This reality requires parentsâ€”and more
specifically moms, who often shoulder more of these household burdens than their partners
doâ€”to renegotiate for themselves, day after day, the battle between the demands of
employment and family. This is a process that unfolds as a thousand cutting decisions and
compromises, each of which seemingly disappoints someone, until you find yourself writing
at 4:00 a.m. next to a precarious pile of laundry. In a particularly heartbreaking (and
distressingly familiar) anecdote from Overwhelmed, Schulte's daughter complains about how
much time her mom spends on the computer. She tells Schulte that when she grows up, she
wants to be a teacher, explaining, "because then at least I'll be able to spend time with
my kids.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 82: Arbitrary Nature of Grinding

The second principle of Slow Productivity suggests that constant grinding without relief
is arbitrary and often self-imposed through our own anxieties rather than external
demands.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The second principle of slow productivity argues that these famous scientists were onto
something. Our exhausting tendency to grind without relief, hour after hour, day after
day, month after month, is more arbitrary than we recognize. It's true that many of us
have bosses or clients making demands, but they don't always dictate the details of our
daily schedulesâ€”it's often our own anxieties that play the role of the fiercest
taskmaster. We suffer from overly ambitious timelines and poorly managed workloads due to
a fundamental uneasiness with ever stepping back from the numbing exhaustion of jittery
busyness.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 82 (continued): Alternative Approach

The author presents an alternative approach where important work is given more breathing
room and allowed to unfold at varying intensities over time, which can be more sustainable
and effective.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
These scientists point toward an alternative approach to scheduling work in which we give
our important efforts more breathing room, allowing them to take longer and unfold with
intensity levels that vary over time. This approach is not only more sustainable and
humane, it's also arguably the better long-term strategy for producing results that
matter.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 83: Principle #2 - Work at a Natural Pace

The second principle of Slow Productivity advocates for not rushing important work and
allowing it to develop naturally with varying intensity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PRINCIPLE #2: WORK AT A NATURAL PACE

Don't rush your most important work. Allow it instead to unfold along a sustainable
timeline, with variations in intensity, in settings conducive to brilliance.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 87: Historical Work Patterns

The author contrasts modern work patterns with historical ones, noting how the shift from
hunting and gathering to agriculture introduced continuous monotonous work that was
previously unknown to humans.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This side-by-side comparison underscores the degree to which our experience of work has
transformed during the recent past of our species. Our shift from hunting and gathering to
agricultureâ€”the Neolithic Revolutionâ€”only really picked up speed somewhere around twelve
thousand years ago. By the time of the Roman Empire, foraging had almost completely
disappeared from the human story. This reorientation toward agriculture threw most of
humanity into a state similar to that of the rice-farming Agta, grappling with something
new: the continuous monotony of unvarying work, all day long, day after day.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 94: Poor Time Estimation

The author discusses how humans are poor at estimating time for cognitive tasks, as we're
wired for tangible efforts and tend to imagine best-case timelines that feel good in the
moment but lead to scrambling later.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
great at estimating the time required for cognitive endeavors. We're wired to understand
the demands of tangible efforts, like crafting a hand ax, or gathering edible plants. When
it comes to planning pursuits for which we lack physical intuition, however, we're
guessing more than we realize, leading us to gravitate toward best-case scenarios for how
long things might take. We seem to seek the thrill that comes from imagining a wildly
ambitious timeline during our planning: "Wow, if I could finish four chapters this fall,
I'd really be ahead of schedule!" It feels good in the moment but sets us up for
scrambling and disappointment in the days that follow.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 95: One for You, One for Me Strategy

The author suggests balancing scheduled meetings with equal amounts of protected time for
yourself on the same day.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A subtler alternative is to instead implement a "one for you, one for me" strategy. Every
time you add a meeting to your calendar for a given day, find an equal amount of time that
day to protect. If I schedule thirty minutes for a call on Tuesday, I'll also find another
thirty minutes that day to block off on my calendar as protected for myself.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 106: Work in Cycles

The author describes Basecamp's practice of working in 6-8 week "cycles" followed by
2-week "cooldown" periods, emphasizing the importance of respecting these recovery
periods.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Work in Cycles The software development company Basecamp is known for experimenting with
innovative management practices. This is perhaps not surprising given that its cofounder
and current CEO, Jason Fried, once published a book titled It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at
Work. One of Basecamp's more striking policies is the consolidation of work into "cycles."
Each such cycle lasts from six to eight weeks. During those weeks, teams focus on clear
and urgent goals. Crucially, each cycle is then followed by a two-week "cooldown" period
in which employees can recharge while fixing small issues and deciding what to tackle
next. "It's sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit
in more work," explains the Basecamp employee handbook. "But the goal is to resist this
temptation."
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 121: Principle #3 - Obsess Over Quality

The third principle of Slow Productivity emphasizes focusing on the quality of work, which
can provide leverage for greater freedom in the long term.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PRINCIPLE #3: OBSESS OVER QUALITY

Obsess over the quality of what you produce, even if this means missing opportunities in
the short term. Leverage the value of these results to gain more and more freedom in your
efforts over the long term.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 127: Quality as Leverage

The author shares examples of how obsessing over quality can provide leverage for greater
control over one's schedule, and how this doesn't necessarily require becoming a superstar
but rather developing rare and valuable skills.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Both Jewel and Paul Jarvis discovered a similar lesson in their careers. The marketplace
doesn't care about your personal interest in slowing down. If you want more control over
your schedule, you need something to offer in return. More often than not, your best
source of leverage will be your own abilities. What makes Jarvis's story so heartening is
its demonstration that these benefits of "obsessing" over quality don't necessarily
require that you dedicate your entire life to the blinkered pursuit of superstardom.
Jarvis didn't sell fifteen million records; he instead became, over time, good at core
skills that were both rare and valuable in the particular field in which he worked. But
this was enough, when leveraged properly, to enable significantly more simplicity in his
professional life. We've become so used to the idea that the only reward for getting
better is moving toward higher income and increased responsibilities that we forget that
the fruits of pursuing quality can also be harvested in the form of a more sustainable
lifestyle.
#+END_QUOTE

* Page 140: Progress vs. Perfection

The author provides a strategy for balancing obsession and perfectionism: give yourself
enough time to create something great but not unlimited time, and focus on making progress
rather than perfection.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Your goal is instead reduced to knocking the metaphorical ball back over the net with
enough force for the game to proceed. Here we find as good a general strategy for
balancing obsession and perfectionism as I've seen: Give yourself enough time to produce
something great, but not unlimited time. Focus on creating something good enough to catch
the attention of those whose taste you care about, but relieve yourself of the need to
forge a masterpiece. Progress is what matters. Not perfection.
