* Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: summary
:END:
The book consists of 3 parts:

a) *First part* is about major diseases people in the USA die from. Each chapter describes root causes and foods that have (scientifically proven!) been found to reduce the risk or even cure the disease

b) *In the 2nd part* of the book the author devotes his attention to healthy food groups. He specifically writes about which elements inside ingredients/foods are responsible for preventing/curing a disease

The first 2 parts are full of references to scientific papers and provide evidence for the authors statements.

c) *The 3rd part* of the book contains the full list of references which IMHO is a tremendous amount of research effort.

In general the author keeps emphasizing that a plant-based nutrition could prevent most of the diseases our society suffers from. But for the industry plants don't really pay the bills. For this reason the pharma industry has a huge interest in promoting their pills over a healthy nutrition. We're constantly eating ourselves to an early unnecessary death while giving lots of money to the industry.

Dr. Greger also has a donation based, non-profit website where all the books contents have gone to. He doesn't offer any products and also avoids any (branded) food recommendations. For me it seems he doesn't have any motivation to sell something there.

#+begin_quote
Everything on [[https://nutritionfacts.org/][]][[#NutritionFacts][NutritionFacts]].org is provided absolutely
free of charge. There's no special member area where you pay a fee to get extra
lifesaving information. What membership websites seem to be saying, in essence,
is that if you don't give them money, they'll withhold information that could
make your family healthier. That's unacceptable to me. Advances in health
sciences should be freely available and accessible to all
#+end_quote

*Now about the bad stuff*:

- his ultimate recommendation is that everyone should become a vegan (although he doesn't stick to any "diet"-ism)
- he doesn't recommend olive oil for which there are many (also scientifically proven) positive health benefits
- also avoids fermented milk which again has scientific evidence for healthy benefits

Here are my notes.

* From heart disease
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: from-heart-disease
:END:
- Nutrition plays an important role
  - 1930-1940s several studies between Western and non-Western population revealed that heart attack disease was almost absent in the non-Western countries
  - similar results in "[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/178788.The%5FChina%5FStudy][The China Study]]"
- Main reason for plaque buildup is [[/zk/cholesterol][cholesterol]]
  - Optimal level: 50/70 mg/dL
  - Especially LDL [[/zk/cholesterol][cholesterol]]
    - The vehicle by which chesterol is deposited into arteries
  - Main sources
    - trans fat
    - saturated fat
    - dietary cholesterol (eggs)
- Fish oil
  - no evidence of positive benefits against heart attack/stroke
  - check out studies: [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456725/][DART, DART-2]]

* From digestive cancers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: from-digestive-cancers
:END:
- Meat
  - check out [[https://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/][NIH-AARP]] study
  - study over a decade
  - 545000 men and women (between 50-71)
  - results: meat consumption increased mortality
  - Possible explanation
    - excess of iron (as in blood or muscle) can generate cancer-causing free radicals
    - human body has no mechanism to get rid of excess iron
    - check out [[https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heme-iron/][heme iron]]

Nowadays, we know better and can compare the cost of foods based on their
nutritional content. An average serving of vegetables may cost roughly four
times more than the average serving of junk food, but those veggies have been
calculated to average twenty-four times more nutrition. So on a
cost-per-nutrition basis, vegetables offer six times more nutrition per dollar
compared to highly processed foods. Meat costs about three times more than
vegetables yet yields sixteen times less nutrition based on an aggregate of
nutrients.4 Because meat is less nutritious and costs more, vegetables net you
forty-eight times more nutrition per dollar than meat.

Most deaths in the united states are preventable, and they are related to what
we eat. Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one
cause of disability. Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in
medical schools, right?
