Instead of a big bowl of spaghetti with some veggies and lentils on top, I think
of a big bowl of vegetables with some pasta and lentils mixed in. Instead of a
big plate of brown rice with some stir-fried vegetables on top, I picture a meal
that''s some rice and beans in there too.

** Is healthy food more expensive?                                             :quote:

Nowadays, we know better and can compare the cost of foods based on their
nutritional content. An average serving of vegetables may cost roughly four
times more than the average serving of junk food, but those veggies have been
calculated to average twenty-four times more nutrition. So on a
cost-per-nutrition basis, vegetables offer six times more nutrition per dollar
compared to highly processed foods. Meat costs about three times more than
vegetables yet yields sixteen times less nutrition based on an aggregate of
nutrients.4 Because meat is less nutritious and costs more, vegetables net you
forty-eight times more nutrition per dollar than meat.

Most deaths in the united states are preventable, and they are related to what
we eat. Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one
cause of disability. Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in
medical schools, right?
