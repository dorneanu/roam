After reading Cal Newportâ€™s book on "[[id:abd6a1c6-fad0-4396-94f8-edc87fe19a0d][deep work]]", listening to his podcast on productivity
and time management, this book felt like a waste of time. There are tons of other good
books on productivity, time management/self-management. This one is definitely not a good
one.
