* Notes
** Constitutional Challenges and Democratic Reform
*** Aging Constitution (p.17)

The Constitution, while providing stability, now threatens democracy through its
pre-democratic design.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
That leads us to another unsettling truth. Part of the problem we face today lies in
something many of us venerate: our Constitution. America has *the world's oldest written
constitution*. A brilliant work of political craftsmanship, it has provided a foundation
for stability and prosperity. And for more than two centuries it has succeeded in checking
the power of ambitious and overreaching presidents. But *flaws in our Constitution now
imperil our democracy*. 

Designed in a *pre-democratic era*, the U.S. Constitution allows *partisan minorities to
routinely thwart majorities*, and sometimes even govern them. Institutions that empower
partisan minorities can become *instruments of minority rule*. And they are especially
dangerous when they are in the hands of *extremist or antidemocratic partisan minorities*.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Historical Minority Rule (p.127)

The *three-fifths clause* gave slave states disproportionate representation.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The biggest victory for the southern states, however, was the notorious *"three-fifths
clause,"* which allowed them to *count enslaved people as part of each state's population*
(five slaves counted as three free persons) for the purposes of legislative apportionment,
even though slaves had no rights. This expanded the *slave states' representation in the
House*, which also increased their influence in the Electoral College. In this way, the
southern slaveholding minority achieved its demand for what the South Carolina delegate
Charles Pinckney called "something like an equality." For example, in 1790,
*Massachusetts's voting population was greater than Virginia's*, but since Virginia had
300,000 slaves
#+END_QUOTE

** Current Democratic Challenges
*** Racial Inequality (p.13)

The disparate treatment of citizens based on race remains evident in the justice system.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you have any doubt that *Black citizens do not enjoy the same rights under the law as
white citizens*, apply the Kyle Rittenhouse test: Could a *young Black man cross state
lines with a semiautomatic rifle, walk unmolested by police into a protest, fire into a
crowd, kill two people, and go free?*
#+END_QUOTE

*** Democratic Decline (p.14)

U.S. democracy shows significant decline in global rankings since 2015.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Freedom House's Global Freedom Index gives countries a score between 0 and 100 each year,
with 100 being the most democratic. In 2015, the United States received a score of *90*,
which was roughly in line with countries like Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan,
Spain, and the U.K. But after that, *America's score declined steadily, reaching 83 in
2021*. Not only was that score *lower than every established democracy in western Europe*,
but it was *lower than new or historically troubled democracies* like Argentina, the Czech
Republic, Lithuania, and Taiwan.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Senate Representation Imbalance (p.143)

Republican senators have consistently represented a minority of Americans in the 21st
century.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Or look at it another way: *At no time during the twenty-first century have Senate
Republicans represented a majority of the U.S. population*. Based on states' populations,
Senate Democrats have continuously represented more Americans since 1999. In the 2016
election, for example, the Republicans won a fifty-two-seat Senate majority. But their
senators represented *only 45 percent of Americans*. In 2018, the GOP won a fifty-three-seat
majority, but again, its senators represented only a minority (*48 percent*) of Americans.
After the 2020 election, which left the Senate evenly split, the *fifty Democratic
senators represented 55 percent of Americans‚Äî41.5 million more people than the fifty
Republican senators*. The pattern continued in 2022: the GOP continued to hold more Senate
seats (forty-nine) than its vote share (*42 percent*).
#+END_QUOTE

** Principles of Democracy
*** Democratic Acceptance (p.21)

Democracy requires accepting electoral losses.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As the political scientist Adam Przeworski memorably put it, *"Democracy is a system in
which parties lose elections."* Losing hurts, but in a democracy it is inevitable. And when
it happens, parties must do what the Peronists did: *accept defeat, go home, and then
figure out how to win a majority in the next election*.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Core Democratic Requirements (p.40)

Three *fundamental commitments* required of democratic politicians.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Politicians who are committed to democracy, or what the political scientist Juan Linz
called *loyal democrats*, must always do *three basic things*. First, they must *respect the
outcome of free and fair elections, win or lose*. 

This means consistently and unhesitatingly accepting defeat.

Second, democrats must *unambiguously reject violence* (or the threat of violence) as a
means of achieving political goals. Politicians who support military coups, organize
putsches, incite insurrections, plot bombings, assassinations, and other terrorist acts,
or deploy militias or thugs to beat up opponents or intimidate voters are not democrats.
Indeed, any party or politician that violates either of these two basic rules should be
considered *a threat to democracy*. 

But there is a third, more subtle action required of loyal democrats: they must *always
break with antidemocratic forces*. Democracy's assassins always have accomplices‚Äîpolitical
insiders who appear to abide by democracy's rules but quietly assault them.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Democratic Enablers (p.41)

The danger of mainstream parties tolerating extremists.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Democracies get into trouble when *mainstream parties tolerate, condone, or protect
authoritarian extremists*‚Äîwhen they become *authoritarian enablers*. Indeed, throughout
history, *cooperation between authoritarians and seemingly respectable semi-loyal democrats
has been a recipe for democratic breakdown*.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Democracy in Spain (p.45)

#+begin_quote
This is how democracy is defended. In Spain, the date of February 23 is celebrated
publicly as a moment of triumph. In 2006, on the event‚Äôs twenty-fifth anniversary, the
parliament issued a statement, endorsed by all parties, that described the coup as ‚Äúthe
gravest attempt to forcefully violate freedoms and to abort the democratic process in
Spain.‚Äù No one excused the attempted coup. No one downplayed
#+end_quote

*** Balance of Powers (p.115)

Democracy requires both majority rule and minority rights protection.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Part of the answer is that *democracy needs rules that limit the power of majorities*.
Modern democracy is *not simply a system of majority rule*; it combines *majority rule and
minority rights*. Early defenders of limited government feared excessive concentrations of
power‚Äînot only in the hands of kings, but also in the hands of popular majorities. And so
the form of democracy that emerged in the West between the late eighteenth and the
twentieth centuries, which today we call *"liberal" democracy*, is based on *two pillars:
collective self-rule (majority rule) and civil liberties (minority rights)*. Although
liberal democracy cannot exist without free and fair elections, *not everything can or
should be up for grabs in elections*.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Constraints on Majority Power (p.117)

Majorities must be prevented from undermining democratic competition.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Majorities must also be constrained in a second area: *the rules of democracy itself*.
Elected governments must *not be able to use their temporary majorities to entrench
themselves in power* by changing the rules of the game in ways that weaken their opponents
or undermine fair competition. This is the specter of *"majority tyranny"*: the possibility
that a government will use its popular or parliamentary majority to *vote the
opposition‚Äîand democracy‚Äîout of existence*.
#+END_QUOTE

** Democratic Reform Strategies
*** Broad Coalition Building (p.179)

Historical examples of democratic forces uniting against extremism.

- *Finland, early 1930s:*
  - The leftist Social Democrats joined with center and center-right parties.
  - Formed a broad-based Legality Front to counteract the fascist Lapua Movement.
- *Belgium:*
  - Center-left Labor Party joined forces with:
    - Conservative Catholic Party
    - Centrist Liberals
  - Created a right-leaning unity government.
  - Aimed to defeat the fascist Rexist Party.

#+begin_quote
One strategy, born in the darkest days of 1930s Europe, is to corral all democratic-minded
forces into a broad coalition to isolate and defeat antidemocratic extremists. Facing the
specter of a global wave of fascism, many of Europe‚Äôs new democracies came to the brink of
collapse between the two world wars. In some countries, mainstream politicians responded
by setting aside their intense ideological differences and forging broad left-right
coalitions to defend democracy. Acute crises call for extraordinary cooperation; leaders
of rival parties realized they needed to temporarily set aside their policy goals and
forge a common pro-democratic front, both at election time and while governing. In Finland
in the early 1930s,2 the leftist Social Democrats joined center and center-right parties
in a broad-based Legality Front to face down the fascist Lapua Movement. In Belgium,3 the
center-left Labor Party joined forces with the conservative Catholic Party and the
centrist Liberals in a right-leaning unity government to defeat the fascist Rexist Party.
In both cases, coalitions of pro-democratic parties succeeded in keeping extremist forces
out of power (until the Nazis invaded Belgium in 1940).
#+end_quote

*** Electoral Competition (p.181)

Madison's principle of using electoral competition to overcome extremism.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Here we return to a basic principle inspired by James Madison and others: *Extremist
minorities are best overcome through electoral competition*. Madison believed that the *need
to win popular majorities would likely tame the most "sinister" political tendencies*. But
his formula requires that *popular majorities actually prevail in elections*. For that to
happen, America must reform its institutions. The early twentieth century American
reformer Jane Addams once wrote, *"The cure for the ills of Democracy is more Democracy."*
#+END_QUOTE
*** Make voting simple (p.182)

Key measures that make voting simple and accessible in democratic societies: 
- *Automatic Voter Registration:*
  - Once citizens turn eighteen, their names are automatically added to voter rolls.
- *Voting on Weekends:*
  - Elections are typically held on Sundays or other weekends to accommodate working people.
- *Constitutional/Statutory Voting Rights:*
  - Citizens have a guaranteed right to vote as part of the constitution or laws.
- *Obligatory Voting in Some Countries:*
  - In countries like Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Uruguay, voting is
    mandatory, similar to paying taxes.

#+begin_quote
In most democracies, this is not an issue. In a democracy, people are supposed to vote. So most democratic societies grant citizens a constitutional (or at least statutory) right to vote, and government authorities make it as easy as possible for people to vote. In some countries (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Costa Rica, Uruguay), voting is obligatory; it is considered a civic duty, like paying taxes. In nearly all democracies, voter registration is automatic. Once citizens turn eighteen, their names are added to the rolls. And voting is made simple. Nearly all democracies in Europe and Latin America hold elections on the weekend, usually on a Sunday, so that work does not discourage or prevent people from voting. In most established democracies, voter turnout can reach as high as 80 percent. It‚Äôs not rocket science: if governments make it simple for citizens to register and vote, most of them will vote.
#+end_quote
*** Voting Rights and Access (p.182-183)

The need for constitutional voting rights and easier voting access.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the United States, to the surprise of many, there is *no constitutional or even
statutory "right to vote."* The Second Amendment affirmed Americans' right to bear arms,
but *nowhere does the Constitution recognize their right to suffrage*. Later amendments
specified that suffrage may not be denied on the basis of race (Fifteenth Amendment) or
sex (Nineteenth Amendment), but *never has the Constitution positively affirmed Americans'
right to vote*. Likewise, although there are many federal laws protecting voting, no single
federal statute grants all adult citizens the right to cast a ballot. Unlike most
established democracies, the United States has *a long history of governments discouraging
and even suppressing the vote*.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Comprehensive Reforms (p.183-185)

Detailed proposals for democratic reforms.

*üëâ Uphold the right to vote*: 
- *Pass a Constitutional Amendment:*
  - Establish a right to vote for all citizens, providing a solid legal basis to challenge voting restrictions.
- *Automatic Voter Registration:*
  - Register all citizens automatically when they turn eighteen.
  - Accompany this with the automatic distribution of national voting ID cards to all citizens.
- *Expand Early Voting and Mail-In Voting:*
  - Offer easy options for early voting and mail-in voting across all states.
- *Make Election Day a Sunday or National Holiday:*
  - Ensure that work responsibilities do not discourage people from voting by holding elections on weekends or national holidays.
- *Restore Voting Rights to Ex-Felons:*
  - Reinstating voting rights for ex-felons without additional fines or fees once they have served their time.
- *Reinstate Federal Oversight of Election Rules and Administration:*
  - Implement federal oversight in states and localities with a history of voting rights violations, following the Voting Rights Act (VRA) model.
  - Alternatively, apply this oversight to all jurisdictions equally, similar to the model proposed by the 1890 Lodge bill.
- *Replace Partisan Electoral Administration:*
  - Transition from partisan electoral administration to systems managed by professional and nonpartisan officials.
  - This ensures fairness in updating voter rolls, accessing polling places, and managing voting and vote-counting processes.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
UPHOLD THE RIGHT TO VOTE. The right to vote is a core element of any modern definition of
democracy. In representative democracies, citizens elect their leaders. Leaders can only
be elected democratically if all citizens are able to vote. So if voting is costly or
difficult for some citizens‚Äîif they have to stand in line for hours or travel long
distances to vote‚Äîelections cannot be fully democratic.

In the United States,16 to the surprise of many, there is no constitutional or even
statutory ‚Äúright to vote.‚Äù The Second Amendment affirmed Americans‚Äô right to bear arms,
but nowhere does the Constitution recognize their right to suffrage. Later amendments
specified that suffrage may not be denied on the basis of race (Fifteenth Amendment) or
sex (Nineteenth Amendment), but never has the Constitution positively affirmed Americans‚Äô
right to vote. Likewise, although there are many federal laws protecting voting, no single
federal statute grants all adult citizens the right to cast a ballot. Unlike most
established democracies, the United States has a long history of governments discouraging
and even suppressing the vote. Even today,17 America is also one of the few countries on
earth (Belize and Burundi are two others) in which responsibility for voter registration
lies entirely with individual citizens. Voting in America should be as straightforward

This means we should do the following: Pass a constitutional amendment18 establishing a
right to vote for all citizens, which would provide a solid basis to litigate voting
restrictions. Establish automatic registration in which all citizens are registered to
vote when they turn eighteen. This could be accompanied by the automatic distribution of
national voting ID cards to all citizens. The burdens of the registration process should
not deter anyone from voting. Expand early voting and easy mail-in voting options for
citizens of all states. It should be easy for all Americans to cast ballots. Make Election
Day a Sunday or a national holiday, so that work responsibilities do not discourage
Americans from voting. Restore voting rights (without additional fines or fees) to all
ex-felons who have served their time. Restore national-level voting rights protections. In
the spirit of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, parts of which the Supreme Court struck down in
2013, we should reinstate federal oversight of election rules and administration. This
could apply only in states and localities with a history of voting rights violations,
following the VRA model, or to all jurisdictions equally, following the model of the 1890
Lodge bill. Replace the current system of partisan electoral administration with one in
which state and local electoral administration is in the hands of professional,
nonpartisan officials. This will help ensure fairness in the updating of voter rolls,
access to polling places, and the voting and vote-counting processes. Nearly every other
established democracy, from France and Germany to Brazil, Costa Rica, Japan, and South
Africa, has nonpartisan referees to oversee elections.

üëâ *Ensure election outcomes reflect majority preferences*
- *Abolish the Electoral College:*
  - Replace it with a national popular vote system, ensuring the winner of the most votes becomes
    president.

- *Reform the Senate:*
  - Make the number of senators elected per state more proportional to each state's population.
  - For example, states like California and Texas should elect more senators than smaller states
    like Vermont and Wyoming.

- *Replace "First-Past-the-Post" Electoral Rules:*
  - Implement a form of proportional representation for the House of Representatives and state
    legislatures.
  - This would allow voters to elect multiple representatives from larger electoral districts, with
    parties winning seats in proportion to their share of votes.
  - Repeal the 1967 Uniform Congressional District Act, which mandates single-member districts for
    House elections.

- *Eliminate Partisan Gerrymandering:*
  - Create independent redistricting commissions similar to those used in California, Colorado, and
    Michigan.

- *Update the Apportionment Act of 1929:*
  - Return to a design where the size of Congress expands with population growth.
  - This would bring representatives closer to the people and mitigate the small-state bias inherent
    in the current Electoral College system.

ENSURE THAT ELECTION OUTCOMES REFLECT MAJORITY PREFERENCES. Those who win the most votes
should win elections. Nothing in democratic theory justifies allowing losers to win
elections. The political philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote that democracy should ‚Äúgiv[e]
the powers of government in all cases to the numerical majority.‚Äù19 Unfortunately in U.S.
presidential, Senate, and some state legislative elections, this frequently does not
occur. Several steps can be taken to ensure that those who win electoral majorities
actually govern: Abolish the Electoral College and replace it with a national popular
vote. No other presidential democracy permits the loser of the popular vote to win the
presidency. Such a constitutional amendment very nearly passed as recently as 1970. Reform
the Senate so that the number of senators elected per state is more proportional to the
population of each state (as in Germany). California and Texas should elect more senators
than Vermont and Wyoming. Because Article V of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that ‚Äúno
state, without its Consent, may be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate‚Äù (a form
of liberum veto), we understand the barriers to such a reform are enormous. But because
the structure of the Senate so subverts basic democratic principles, and with such great
consequence, any list of important democratizing reforms must include it. Replace
‚Äúfirst-past-the-post‚Äù20 electoral rules and single-member districts for the House of
Representatives and state legislatures with a form of proportional representation in which
voters elect multiple representatives from larger electoral districts and parties win
seats in proportion to the share of the vote they win. This would require repeal of the
1967 Uniform Congressional District Act, which mandates single-member districts for House
elections. By ensuring that the distribution of seats21 in Congress more accurately
reflects the way Americans vote, a proportional representation system would prevent the
problem of ‚Äúmanufactured majorities,‚Äù in which parties that win fewer votes in an election
capture a majority of seats in the legislature. As the political scientist Lee Drutman
writes, a proportional representation system ‚Äútreats all voters equally, regardless of
where they live. And it treats all parties the same, regardless of where their voters
live.‚Äù22 Eliminate partisan gerrymandering via the creation of independent redistricting
commissions such as those used in California, Colorado, and Michigan. Update the
Apportionment Act of 1929, which fixed the House of Representatives at 435, and return to
the original design of a House that expands in line with population growth. At present,
the ratio of voters23 to representatives in the House is nearly five times higher than
that of any European democracy. Expanding the size of Congress would bring representatives
closer to the people, and, if the Electoral College and the current Senate structure
remain in place, mitigate the small-state bias of the Electoral College.

üëâ Empower governing majorities
- *Abolish the Senate Filibuster:*
  - Eliminate the ability of partisan minorities to repeatedly and permanently thwart legislative majorities.
  - This reform does not require statutory or constitutional change.
- *Establish Term Limits for Supreme Court Justices:*
  - Implement term limits (e.g., twelve or eighteen years) to regularize the Supreme Court appointment process.
  - Ensure that every president has an equal number of appointments per term, similar to other established democracies.
- *Make It Easier to Amend the Constitution:*
  - Reduce the requirement for state legislature ratification from three-quarters to a supermajority in both the House and Senate (e.g., two-thirds).
  - This would align with many other major democracies, including federal systems like Germany and India.
- *Regularize Supreme Court Appointments:*
  - Limit intergenerational counter-majoritarianism by ensuring justices serve for a fixed term rather than lifetime appointments.

EMPOWER GOVERNING MAJORITIES. Finally, Americans must take steps to empower legislative
majorities by weakening counter-majoritarian legislative and judicial institutions:
Abolish the Senate filibuster (a reform that requires neither statutory nor constitutional
change), thereby eliminating the ability of partisan minorities to repeatedly and
permanently thwart legislative majorities. In no other established democracy is such a
minority veto routinely employed. Establish term limits (perhaps twelve or eighteen years)
for Supreme Court justices to regularize the Supreme Court appointment process so that
every president has the same number of appointments per term. Such a reform would place
the United States in the mainstream of all other major democracies in the world. This
would also limit the court‚Äôs intergenerational counter-majoritarianism. Make it easier to
amend the Constitution by eliminating the requirement that three-quarters of state
legislatures ratify any proposed amendment. Requiring two-thirds supermajorities in both
the House of Representatives and the Senate for a constitutional amendment would bring
America in line with most other established democracies, including federal democracies
like Germany and India, as well as many U.S. states. These reforms would have a simple yet
powerful effect: they would allow majorities to win power and govern. Not only would our
proposed reforms help stave off minority rule, but they would also eliminate
constitutional protectionism, unleashing the competitive dynamics of democracy.
Importantly, the reforms would compel the Republicans to build broader coalitions in order
to win. In America today, these coalitions would necessarily be more diverse, which would
dilute the influence of the most extremist elements in the Republican Party. A more
diverse Republican Party capable of winning national majorities fair and square might be
bad news in electoral terms for the Democratic Party, but it would be very good news for
American democracy. The reforms we propose might appear radical, but they are already in
place in the vast majority of established democracies, including highly successful ones
like Denmark, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden. Making it simpler to
vote, ending gerrymandering, replacing the Electoral College with a direct popular vote,
eliminating the Senate filibuster, making Senate representation more proportional

** Historical Perspective and Future Vision
*** Historical Change (p.187)

The possibility of achieving seemingly impossible reforms.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Just because an idea is not taken seriously today doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken
seriously‚Äîor that it won't be taken seriously in the future. During the early nineteenth
century, the idea of *ending slavery was considered unthinkable* in mainstream America, and
abolitionists were dismissed as dreamers. When the *women's suffrage movement was born in
the 1840s, no country in the world granted women the right to vote*. Well into the
twentieth century, mainstream America considered the idea of women's suffrage absurd. And
for decades after the Civil War, the pursuit of *racial equality and civil rights was seen
as impracticable, if not impossible*. In each case, *the mainstream view changed radically*.
But for that to happen, *someone had to start a public conversation*.

The founders actually knew this. They were *not wedded to the original version of the

generations would‚Äîand should‚Äîmodify them. In 1787, just after the Philadelphia Convention,
George Washington wrote, "The warmest friends and best supporters the Constitution has, do
not contend that it is free from imperfections; but found them unavoidable." If problems
arose from these imperfections, Washington wrote, "the remedy must come hereafter." He
went on to write that the American people *"can, as they will have the advantage of
experience on their Side, decide with as much propriety on the alterations and amendments
which are necessary as ourselves. I do not think we are more inspired, have more wisdom,
or possess more virtue, than those who will come after us."*

the streets in the name of justice in the summer of 2020. The young people who marched

* Analysis
** Minority Rule
Minority factions can endanger established democracies in several ways, including by
exploiting constitutional rules, tolerating anti-democratic behavior, and subverting the
electoral process [1-4].

*Constitutional Hardball*:
- Minority factions can use constitutional provisions in ways that undermine the spirit of the law, even when they conform to the letter of the law.
- This can include measures such as declaring states of emergency to suspend basic rights, or using legal channels to disenfranchise certain groups.
- Such actions are often couched in legality and may appear benign, but their cumulative effect can tilt the playing field in favor of the minority.

*Tolerance of Anti-democratic Extremism*:
- Semi-loyal democrats, who are mainstream politicians that appear to abide by democratic rules, may tolerate or even cooperate with anti-democratic extremists.
- They may remain silent, downplay, or justify the violent or anti-democratic actions of their allies.
- By doing so, they legitimize extremist ideas, normalize the extremists themselves, and create an environment where democracy can collapse.
- This tolerance can also send a message that the cost of anti-democratic behavior has been lowered, further encouraging such behavior.

*Subversion of the Electoral Process*:
- Minority factions may use institutions to thwart the will of the majority.
- This can include using the *Electoral College* to win the presidency despite losing the popular vote, or using the *Senate filibuster* to block legislation backed by large majorities.
- First-past-the-post electoral systems can also allow parties that win fewer votes to control legislatures.
- Some groups may also try to use fringe legal theories to subvert the electoral process, such as the "independent state legislature doctrine".

*Reinforcement of Authoritarianism*:
- Counter-majoritarian institutions can shield minority parties from competitive pressures, enabling them to hold on to power even while appealing to a narrow, extremist base
- Minority parties can use their power to solidify control over other institutions, such as the Supreme Court, further entrenching minority rule

*Historical Examples*:
- In the early days of the U.S., Federalists tried to destroy their opponents, the Democratic-Republicans, by using the Alien and Sedition Acts to jail politicians and newspaper editors.
- Federalists also explored ways to subvert the electoral process in the 1800 election, including creating a committee to decide which votes to count and trying to transfer the authority to appoint electors.
- In the post-Civil War South, white supremacist Democrats used tactics of terror and fraud to regain power, and then later used legal channels to disenfranchise African Americans.
- In 1930's Europe, some mainstream politicians tolerated or even allied with extremist groups and parties that sought to undermine democracy.
- In Germany, conservatives maintained political dominance despite losing elections by using an electoral system that was tilted in their favor.
- In the 21st century, governments in Hungary and Israel have used their parliamentary majorities to impose constitutional and electoral reforms that weakened the opposition and judiciary.
** Improve democratic forces
To improve the functionality of democracies, the authors suggest concrete recommendations, which can be categorized into the following clusters:

- Voting and Election Administration Reforms:
  - Easier voter registration and ballot casting: Most democratic societies ensure citizens have a constitutional right to vote and simplify the voting process.
  - Professional, nonpartisan election officials: Replacing partisan electoral administration with professional, nonpartisan officials ensures fairness in voter rolls, polling place access, and vote counting.
  - Ensuring election outcomes reflect majority preferences: The source notes that those "who win the most votes should win elections".
  - Measures to increase participation in elections.

- Electoral System Changes:
  - Abolishing the Electoral College and using a national popular vote: The source points out that "no other presidential democracy allows the loser of the popular vote to win the presidency".
  - Reforming the Senate to align senator numbers with state population sizes: This is similar to the system in Germany.
  - Ending partisan gerrymandering using independent redistricting commissions: This is similar to those used in California, Colorado, and Michigan.
  - Updating the Apportionment Act of 1929 to expand the House of Representatives: This would bring representatives closer to the people.
  - Replacing "first-past-the-post" system.

- Reforms to Address Minority Rule:
  - Dismantling spheres of undue minority protection and empowering majorities at all levels of government.
  - Ending constitutional protectionism and unleashing real political competition.
  - Bringing the balance of political power more closely in line with voter preferences.
  - Forcing politicians to be more responsive and accountable to majorities of Americans.
  - Eliminating the Senate filibuster.
