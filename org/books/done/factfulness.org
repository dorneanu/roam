- The Gap instinct
  - Look for the majority
  - People have a binary perspective of the world
  - There are 4 levels/categories how world population should be splitted to (based on income per day) (Souce: [[https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels]])
    - Level 1 (0-2 $)
      - 1 Billion people
    - Level 2 (2-8 $)
      - 3 Billions people
    - Level 3 (8-32 $)
      - 2 Billions people
    - Level 4 (32- ... $)
      - 1 Billion people
  - Usually there is no gap
    - most of the time you have an overlap
  - look for the majority
    - don't compare averages
    - don't compare extremes (majority is usually somewhere in between where the gap should be)
    - don't look from up here (it distorts the view)

- The generalization instinct
  - Question your categories
  - [[https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street]]
  - Beware of the majority
    - When someone says that a majority of a group has some property it can sound like most of them have something in common. Remember that majority just means more than half. It could mean 51%. It could mean 99%. If possible, ask for the percentage.
- The destiny instinct
  - Slow change is still a change
- The single perspective instinct
  - Get a tool box

  - is always good

    A single typo in your CV and you probably don't get the job. But if you put 1 billion people on the wrong continent you can still get hired. You can even get a promotion.

Take for example, girl's education. Educating girls has proven to be one the world's best-ever ideas. When women are educated, all kinds of wonderful things happen in societies. The workforce becomes diversified and able to make better decisions and solve more problems. Educated mothers decide to have fewer children and more children survive. More energy and time is invested in each child's education. It's a virtuous cycle of change.
