Welcome, bine ai venit, willkommen! My name is [[https://dornea.nu][Victor Dorneanu]] and this is the place where I store my so called *external brain*. This project is aimed at collecting almost everything I know or try to remember. What you see right now is basically my *personal knowledge base* built with [[id:5329cb10-9f3e-4311-bc69-542775991244][org-roam]].

Although I still haven't figured out how to perfectly structure my notes, quotes and these are some areas you can read about:

  - At the moment I mainly develop in [[id:b2831721-165d-4943-a41a-da770d96be41][Golang]] and [[id:e4dd5a6c-5c20-48d4-9d9a-408893dc8ce6][Python]]
