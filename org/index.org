Welcome, bine ai venit, willkommen! My name is [[https://dornea.nu][Victor Dorneanu]] and this is the place where I store my so called *external brain*. This project is aimed at collecting almost everything I know or try to remember. What you see right now is basically my personal knowledge base built with org-roam.

Although I still haven't figured out how to perfectly structure my notes, quotes and these are some areas you can read about:
