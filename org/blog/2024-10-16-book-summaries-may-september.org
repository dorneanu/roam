#+created: 2024-10-16

Keeping with the theme I've started a few months ago, here are my own book
summaries for the books I've read between /May/ and /September/ this year.

* Social Sciences and Psychology
** ðŸ“š Lost Connections
ðŸ‘‰ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections][Lost Connections - Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the
  Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari]]

After reading {{{zk_book(the-lonely-century,The Lonely Century)}}} last year, which
opened my eyes to the increasing /isolation/ in our lives, I was kind of motivated
to read more on that topic. That's how I've found out about
{{{zk_book(lost-connections,Lost Connections)}}} which is an exploration of /depression/
and its root causes.

The book introduces the concept of "/disconnection/" as a primary cause of depression. Hari
outlines seven types of disconnection. He talks about disconnection from /meaningful work/,
/other people/, /meaningful values/, /childhood trauma/, /status and respect/, the /natural world/
and from a /hopeful or secure future/.

What I found particularly insightful was Hari's exploration of ways to "/reconnect/." These
strategies offer paths to a more meaningful and enjoyable life, emphasizing our
connections to others and reminding us that "/humans are nature/" already. This perspective
adds a new dimension to my understanding of focus and attention, placing them within a
broader context of human well-being and social connection.

** ðŸ“š Stolen Focus

ðŸ‘‰ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus][Stolen Focus - Why You Can't Pay Attention - and How to Think Deeply Again by Johann Hari]]

After the impactful experience of reading {{{zk_book(lost-connections,Lost
Connections)}}} I felt compelled to delve into another of Hari's works. While "Lost
Connections" explored /depression/ and our daily /micro-interactions/ with people
and nature, "*Stolen Focus*" takes a more scientific, empirical approach to
investigating various aspects of /attention/.

One concept that immediately struck me was *James Willson*'s layered /model of attention/:

1. *Spotlight* attention (first layer):
   - Focuses on immediate actions like making coffee or reading a chapter.
   - Involves narrowing down focus.
   - Distraction at this level disrupts near-term actions.

2. *Starlight* attention (second layer):
   - Concentrates on longer-term goals such as writing a book or being a good parent.
   - Acts as a guide when feeling lost, much like stars in the sky.
   - Distraction here can cause us to lose sight of our longer-term objectives.

3. *Daylight* attention (third layer):
   - Enables understanding of our longer-term goals.
   - Requires clear thinking and reflection.
   - Compared to daylight illuminating a scene clearly.
   - Distraction at this level can lead to losing our sense of personal identity and direction.

As I continued reading, I was amazed by Hari's comprehensive approach to the *attention
crisis*. He doesn't just point to the usual suspects like increasing /screen time/ and /social
media usage/. Instead, he adds a more nuanced picture of our changing relationship with
information and mental states. Therefore here are some aspects which lead to the deterioration
of our ability to focus and pay attention:

1. The decline of book reading
   - Having learned about the benefits of reading from [[https://calnewport.com/][Cal Newport]], I found Hari's
     exploration of how people are giving up on books particularly resonant. It's not just
     about reading (like you do for entertainment reasons), but about the /cognitive
     benefits/ that extended, focused reading provides.

2. The loss of mind-wandering
   - This was an eye-opening concept for me which I've first met when Cal
     Newport was talking about the power of /solitude/ in his book
     {{{zk_book(digital-minimalism,Digital Minimalism)}}}. Hari argues that we're not
     only losing our ability to focus but also our capacity for /unstructured
     thought/ (aka mind-wandering, just do nothing). In our constant desire to
     stay "productive" or entertained, we've eliminated those crucial moments of
     mental downtime.

3. The state of constant skimming
   - Perhaps most alarmingly, Hari suggests that we're often neither focusing nor
     mind-wandering, but exist in a state of /constant skimming/. We're processing a
     never-ending /influx of information/ without truly processing it or allowing our minds
     to rest and reflect.

These insights have made me reconsider not just how I manage my attention, but
how I conceptualize it. It's clear that reclaiming our focus isn't just about
reducing screen time or blocking distractions â€“ it's about fundamentally
restructuring how we engage with information and allow our minds to work.

* History and Anthropology
** ðŸ“š Sapiens

ðŸ‘‰ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens][Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari]]

After becoming a Harari fan through "21 Lessons for the 21st Century" I was eager to dive
into "*Sapiens*". I consumed both books as audiobooks, each one quite long. While the audio
format was convenient, I found myself wishing for a physical or e-book copy to take notes.
The depth and breadth of Harari's books make me think I'll likely revisit these books in
the future for a more in-depth study.

In a nutshell "Sapiens" is about how *Homo sapiens* came to dominate the planet. Harari
talks about the story of our species' rise, from /outcompeting other human species/ (like
Neanderthals) to our impact on the animal kingdom, including the /extinction of many
species/ through hunting. This narrative is a very interesting look at our species'
historical impact on the planet.

Despite some criticism (I've had some serious discussions with my mother, who strongly
dislikes Harari), I believe the author does an excellent job explaining the /evolution of
fundamental human developments/ like writing and reading. He delves into the motivations
behind these advancements, providing insights into why and how they occurred.

What I particularly appreciate about "Sapiens" is its /interdisciplinary approach/ (I guess
this applies to all of his books). Harari touches on various aspects of human development,
including /religion/, /economy/, /sociology/, and /politics/. This comprehensive view offers
readers a deeper understanding of the society we currently live in, explaining the origins
of our laws and different political systems.

A /key takeaway/ from the book, which resonates with thoughts I've encountered in other
sources, is Harari's explanation of what distinguishes Homo sapiens from other species:

1. Our ability to /collaborate collectively/ towards a common goal.
2. Our capacity for abstract thought and /storytelling/, which has been the foundation for
   countless innovations. As Harari points out, everything ever built started as someone's
   imagination - an idea also explored by Sir Ken Robinson in "Imagine If"
3. The development of /language/ (both written and spoken), which allowed us to exchange
   information (across borders and generations).

These unique aspects have allowed our species to create /complex societies/, develop
/advanced technologies/, and ultimately shape the world as we know it today. I highly
recommend "Sapiens" to anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of /human
history/. While it may challenge some preconceptions, it offers a thought-provoking journey
through the history of our species that I found both enlightening and engaging.

* Sociology and Current Affairs
** ðŸ“š Triggerpunkte (Trigger Points)

ðŸ‘‰ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199211943-triggerpunkte][Triggerpunkte - Konsens und Konflikt in der Gegenwartsgesellschaft]]

In the context of Europe's (and beyond) current political landscape, marked by a
noticeable /right-wing shift/, "*Triggerpunkte*" offers a insightful analysis of
/societal tensions/ in Germany. As someone who doesn't consider himself
politically active, I found myself increasingly concerned about the polarized
and extreme nature of political discourse in Germany. The rise of the /AfD/ to a
level of influence that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago exemplifies this
shift.

"Triggerpunkte" presents the findings of a team of sociologists (Steffen Mau,
Thomas Lux, Linus Westheuser) who conducted /empirical research/ across Germany.
What struck me about their approach was the diversity of their
{{{zk_book(triggerpunkte/#klassenschema-nach-daniel-oesch,subject groups)}}}:

- Participants came from various "/political classes/"
- They represented /different professions/ (teachers, handymen, business people, etc.)
- The study included people from both /East and West Germany/

The researchers posed questions on controversed issues such as /immigration/,
/climate change/, /LGBTQ+ inclusion/, and /income inequality/ in Germany. By measuring
emotional responses, they identified topics with /high conflict potential/ across
different groups. They also explored /correlations/ between people's arguments and
factors like educational background, political affiliation, income, age, and
origin.

This book had a profound impact on me. It helped me understand the frustrations
many people have with the current German government, their fears about the
/impact/ of /climate change/ countermeasures, and why some perceive immigrants as a
significant threat. These insights are crucial for anyone trying to comprehend
the current political dynamics in Germany.

One of the most reassuring
{{{zk_book(triggerpunkte/#politisierung-und-konflikt-in-der-gegenwartsgesellschaft,findings)}}}
from the study, in my opinion, was that overall, German society maintains:
- A positive stance towards welcoming immigration policies
- Support for better climate protection
- A generally non-homophobic attitude

However, the study also revealed a /small group of individuals/
({{{zk_book(https://brainfck.org/book/triggerpunkte/#polarisierungsunternehmer,Polarisierungsunternehmer)}}}),
some with political interests, propagate extreme arguments. These actors attempt
to influence mass media perception through /fake news/ and /whataboutism/, aiming to
create more /cleavages/ within the society. The authors' discussion of these
{{{zk_book(triggerpunkte/#cleavages,cleavages)}}} was particularly enlightening.

Reading "Triggerpunkte" has given me a more nuanced understanding of the complex social
and political landscape in contemporary Germany. It's a crucial read for anyone seeking to
understand the underlying factors driving current political trends, not just in Germany
but potentially in other countries facing similar challenges.

** ðŸ“š When the Body Says No

ðŸ‘‰ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/450534.When_the_Body_Says_No][When the Body Says No: The Cost of Hidden Stress (by Gabor Mate)]]

My journey to Gabor MatÃ©'s work began with an interview I stumbled upon between
MatÃ© and Guy Rose, host of "[[https://londonreal.tv/][London Real]]". I was immediately captivated by MatÃ©'s
clear and profound explanations on various aspects of /trauma/, which prompted me
to delve into his book, "When the Body Says No".

At the core of MatÃ©'s argument is the /inseparability/ of /body/, /soul/, and /mind/ - a
holistic view that challenges conventional medical approaches. Throughout the
book, MatÃ© presents case studies from his medical practice, illustrating how
physical pains often have roots in (childhood) trauma that manifest as
chronic stress within patients. 

One of the most enlightening aspects of the book is MatÃ©'s exploration of
/stress/, drawing on the work of [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/338094.Hans_Selye][Hans Selye]]. MatÃ© uses Selye's definition to
provide a comprehensive understanding of stress and its various facets:

#+begin_quote
In searching for a word to capture the meaning of the physical changes he
observed in his experiments, Selye "stumbled upon the term stress, which had
long been used in common English, and particularly in engineering, to denote the
effects of a force acting against a resistance." He gives the example of changes
induced in a stretched rubber band or in a steel spring under pressure. These
changes may be noted with the naked eye or may be evident only on microscopic
examination.

Selye's analogies illustrate an important point: excessive stress occurs when
the demands made on an organism exceed that organism's reasonable capacities to
fulfill them. The rubber band snaps, the spring becomes deformed. The stress
response can be set off by physical damage, either by infection or injury. It
can also be triggered by emotional trauma or just by the threat of such trauma,
even if purely imaginary. Physiological stress responses can be evoked when the
threat is outside conscious awareness or even when the individual may believe
himself to be stressed in a "good" way.
#+end_quote

This definition of stress provides a crucial framework for understanding how
*emotional and psychological experiences can manifest in physical symptoms*. It
underscores MatÃ©'s central thesis that our mental and emotional states have
profound impacts on our physical health.

MatÃ©'s work challenges us to consider the long-term health implications of our
emotional experiences and the importance of addressing psychological well-being
as a key component of overall health.
