Inspired by Eli Bendersky's [[https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/book-reviews][book reviews]], here are my summaries for the books I've read
between January and April 2024.

1. üìö [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55539565-think-again][Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know by Adam Grant]]

   - I've received this book shortly after reading {{{zk_book(the-scout-mindset, The Scout Mindset)}}} where I learned about the /soldier/ vs /scout/ mindset where the later one can be shortly described in one quote:
     #+begin_quote
     ‚ÄúYour strength as a scout is in your ability‚Ä¶ to think in shades of gray instead of black and white.‚Äù
     #+end_quote

   - /Think again/ is more about different types of thinking (the preacher, the prosecutor, the politian and the scientist) and their main characteristics. I also learned that a debate is more like a [[https://brainfck.org/book/think-again/#part-2-interpersonal-rethinking][dance]] where the choreography between the partners has not been negotiated yet. Each one has his own steps in mind but professional debators know how to "end up in rhythm" with their partners. Adam Grant also gives [[https://brainfck.org/book/think-again/#actions-for-impact][concrete advice]] how to learn to develop the habit of thinking again and revising your own beliefs.

2. üìö [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200314620-the-startup-cto-s-handbook][The Startup CTO's Handbook: Essential skills and best practices for high performing engineering teams by Zach Goldberg]]

   - This is a comprehensive guide for CTOs and technical leaders in startup companies. It covers a wide range of essential topics for these people including technical leadership, team building, technology choices, infrastructure, technical debt. It also gives advice how to master the startup growth, have a fast hiring process, how to retain talent and how to scale technology infrastructure to meet increasing demands.
   - Although I didn't know what to expect, for my gusto it was way to high-level. However,I liked the chapter about the /technical debt/ and its seven types. I also first learned about DX (Developer Experience) which refers to tools & processes to make it easy to "have highly reliable and reproducible environments and depedency chains"

3. üìö [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/37570605][Company Of One: Why Staying Small Is the Next Big Thing for Business by Paul Jarvis]]
   - I remember [[https://calnewport.com/][Cal Newport]] once mentioned this book in one of [[https://calnewport.com/podcasts/][his episodes]] (this is how I got to read this book). In "Company of One" the capitalistic credo of (continuous) growth is questioned. Instead "companies of one" should intentionally stay small. The main focus here is not the competitor's growth but rather focusing on customer relationships and their own success. Acording to Paul Jarvis, if you're focuing on growth, growth will happen. If you, however, want long-term customers and sales, you should focus on your few customers and their needs. There is absolutely no need for infinite growth just for the sake of getting bigger.

4. üìö [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56913172][The Minimalist Entrepreneur: How Great Founders Do More with Less by Sahil Lavingia]]
   - If you know [[https://gumroad.com/][gumroad]] then you probably also know about [[https://sahillavingia.com/][Sahil Lavingia]] who got by this
     [[https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting][essay]]. Compared to the previous books on entrepreneurship this focussed more on the
     community for which you want to build products. Sahil emphasized the crucial part of
     identifying your ideal customers and build solutions for their needs. Once you
     figured out your potential customers, it's time to find out if they're willing to pay
     for your solutions:

     #+begin_quote
     "A business is a way to solve problems for people your care about - and get paid for it."
     #+end_quote

   - The author also suggests you first become a creator and then an entrepreneuer. This
     way you should make sure your creativity is unleashed in order to create the best
     solutions for your business.

5. üìö [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections][Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari]]
   - After having heard a lot about depression, its chemical root causes, the effects on
     humans in Andrew Huberman's [[https://www.hubermanlab.com/][podcast]] I was more than determined to read this book.
     Himself having to deal with depression, Johann Hari takes a journey to find out more
     about the mental ilness that caused him to take pills (a la Prozac) and soon to find
     out they weren't a long-term solution. What if depression was not solely caused by
     some "imbalance of serotonin" in your brain? What if depression was merely a mix of
     environmental factors, childhood traumata and predispotition (genes) to some
     behavioral patterns
   - Hari comes up with 9 causes for depression: /Disconnection/ from 1) meaningful work, 2)
     from other people, 3) from meaningful values, 4) childhood traume, 5) from status and
     respect, 6) from the natural world, 7) from a hopeful and secure future and
     finally 9) role of genes and brain changes. To quote the author, we all need to /reconnect/ again:

     #+begin_quote
     You aren‚Äôt a machine with broken parts. You are an animal whose needs are not being met.
     You need to have a community. You need to have meaningful values, not the junk values
     you‚Äôve been pumped full of all your life, telling you happiness comes through money and
     buying objects. You need to have meaningful work. You need the natural world. You need to
     feel you are respected. You need a secure future. You need connections to all these
     things. You need to release any shame you might feel for having been mistreated.
