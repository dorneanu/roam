#+title: Digital and Analogue: The balance that works for me
#+HUGO_DRAFT: false

There is certainly some frustration with productivity tools that feel more like a burden than a boost. During my career I've tried different digital planners, time-blocking apps, task managers, only to find myself overhelmed by their complexity and not really matching my personal workflow. The truth is, the *tools* are *not* the problem: it's how we use them. Instead of adopting new tools, one should first come up with a strategy/workflow that respects the need for *focus* and *creativity*. Whether it's mapping out a week in a *Frankenlog* or capturing spontaneous ideas in my (analogue) notebook, the goal is always the same: To stay intentional (aka focused) and to not get lost in items/tasks.

* Multi-Scale planning: Foundation of focus
Planning is not just about scheduling - it's about creating a framework to move through time with clarity. I break down my goals into *three* layers: Yearly, quaterly and weekly.

üí° Fresh reminder what multi-scale planning is about (see {{{zk_topic(multi-scale-planning,multi scale planning)}}}):
#+begin_quote
Concepts:
- Multiscale Time Planning
  - The concept involves planning at *multiple time scales*, including monthly/quarterly, weekly, and daily
  - This approach helps to increase the level of detail as you move from larger to smaller scales, which is essential for effective time management.

- Flexibility and Adaptability
  - A crucial principle of multiscale planning is the understanding that *plans are not static*
  - They should be *flexible and adaptable* to changes
  - Adjusting plans as needed is expected, not a deviation from the strategy.
  - You don't get extra points for sticking to the plan

- Monthly/Quarterly Planning
  - This scale is vital for avoiding *deadline-driven* chaos
  - It allows for advanced preparation and scheduling to *meet major deadlines* and handle significant tasks efficiently.
  - It involves breaking down tasks week by week and maintaining a freestyle format for each week's notes, focusing on the big picture and major upcoming events or deadlines.

- Weekly and Daily Planning
  - These scales involve more detailed planning
  - Weekly plans describe scheduled *commitments and tasks for each day of the week*
  - Daily planning is the most detailed, assigning specific tasks to each hour of the day, thus providing control over daily activities

I rely on digital tools like text files, Github issues, Jira tickets, calenders to track *deadlines* and *milestones*. But for the *daily rhythm*, analogue methods are just better suited. My notebook becomes my *anchor*, where I capture thoughts, notes (from meetings), reflect on progress and let ideas flow freely (e.g. sketching the IT architecture for a new service). This dual approach ensures I'm not lost in the noise of *digital overload*, while still maintaining a sense of direction.

* The Frankenlog: Weekly map without overload
The Frankenlog iy my go-to system for *visualizing* my week. My approach to weekly planning is a hybrid of analog and digital: A paper calendar where I sketch out *time blocks* for /work/, /rest/ and /creative projects/, paired with a *digital* version which includes appointments (personal /and/ work related), reminders. For me it serves like a balance between /structure/ and /flexibility/ because I like to know what needs to be done that week.

* Time blocking: Structure capacity, not tasks
Time blocking is *not* about filing every minute with to-dos and use every single possible time gap to do some "productive" (for me this is *busyness* where people suffer from way to ambitious timelines and poorly managed workloads). For me it's more about managing my available time but also my mental capacity to do *cognitively* demanding tasks. Therefore I prioritize *deep work*, *rest*, *sports* but also some recreational time where I can take a break from everything and let my mind just relax (see {{{zk_book(stolen-focus,Stolen Focus)}}} why this is important). My goal is to create *capacity* rather than *load*. For instance, I migh block off a 90-minute slot for *deep work* but afterwards I make sure my brain gets enough time to recover from that intense session. I might then go for a walk, cook or play an instrument. While time blocking visually shows how I plan my day, it's definitely not /static/. Some important meetings might fly in so the whole day schedule has to be rearranged.

* The power of handwriting
There are still many reaons why people didn't abandon handwriting completely. There is some sort of magic in writing by hand that digital notes can't replicate. My analogue /notebook/ is my primaray tool for capturing ideas, tasks and reflections. I ue it to brainstorm future blog posts (like this one üòé), list TODOs for projects (e.g. "gardening tasks" or "balcony redesign") and even sketch out quick visual ideas. It's also part of my daily routine where I take 10 minutes to visually plan and block my day, revisit my quarterly/weekly goals and think about what else I need to accomplish on that day.

The act of writing not only forces me to slow down but it also gives me enough room for creativity flows without interruption. Opening my laptop always felt for me like a disruption especially because you have to log in, find your notetaking tool, type in etc. In contrast, when I write by hand I'm fully engaged (aka focused!) with the moment. My notebook becomes like a tactile extension of my mind, where ideas feel more real and actionable. That said, I'm not *anti-digital*! I still don't want to miss it for scheduling, searching through hundreds of files or for backing up my notes. As always, key is balance: Let analog tools handle the creative and reflective work, use digital tools for further enhancing that workflow.

* Conclusion
The beauty of this approach is that it respects both my need for /structure/ and my /creative/ freedom. I've also learned that productivity isn't about completely eliminating distractions - it's more about creating systems that support my unique rhythm and flow. Whether it's a Frankenlog for weekly planning or a notebook for spontaneous ideas, my goal is to stay /intentional/ about my goals without being lost in TODO items.
