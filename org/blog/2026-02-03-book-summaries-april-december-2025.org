This is a collection of book summaries for the books I read during ~April-December 2025~.
* Politics
** 📚 Baustellen der Nation
Philip Banse & Ulf Buermeyer — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125083585-baustellen-der-nation][Goodreads]] • {{{zk_book(baustellen-der-nation,Notes)}}}

This book is about *construction sites* (German: "Baustellen") of the nation in Germany. It covers
different aspects of what works well in Germany and what doesn't. Among the construction sites
you'll find different chapters on:

- *The land of crumbling bridges*
  
  In general, very little has been invested in infrastructure, especially bridges, over the past
  years/decades. It was no surprise that this *"infrastructure debt"* would sooner or later become very
  expensive, with /Autobahn/ closures forcing people to find alternative routes. The authors discuss
  how this reflects Germany's /"schwarze Null"/ (black zero) /budget policy/ that prioritized balanced
  budgets over necessary investments. They also mention the /bureaucratic hurdles/ that slow down
  infrastructure projects, and how Germany's aging infrastructure puts it at a competitive
  disadvantage compared to countries that have modernized their basic infrastructure.
  
- *The digitalization crisis of German administration*
  
  If you've ever found yourself dealing with German authorities, you know what *bureaucracy* is. PDFs
  are printed out, only to be scanned again and inventoried in some system again. This all happens
  because each state (Bundesland) has its own solution for something that should be offered as a
  "global" *government service* (e.g., "Ausweis beantragen", "Kindergeld beantragen", "Schulkind
  anmelden", etc.). *Not only this, but different vendors are involved which use different formats,
  and of course they don't want to standardize formats because otherwise they won't be able to sell
  their products anymore*. Overall, I think there should be a *general platform* where you have
  core/global services such as "Ausweis beantragen" which should also offer the platform for
  building customized apps. The authors also highlight how Germany lags behind Estonia/Denmark and
  other digital-first countries, and how the lack of digital ID infrastructure creates bottlenecks
  across all government services.
  
- *The German railway (Deutsche Bahn)*
  
  As I'm writing this, I'm literally traveling using Deutsche Bahn. Most of the time, their services
  are just OK, unless some weather conditions arrive which no one foresees and nobody wants to deal
  with - I'm talking about calamities such as snow and storms. The real problem lies in Deutsche
  Bahn's inability to modernize their existing infrastructure and expand the network so that someday
  it should be cheaper to travel by train from Berlin to Munich compared to the costs of a car. *I'm
  a strong believer that once the infrastructure and the service itself is reliable enough, people
  will start using it more often*. Since Deutsche Bahn belongs 100% to the German state, it should
  be a no-brainer that {{{zk_tag(politics,politics)}}} should influence directly in which direction this
  huge company should go, that's not the case. The authors highlight how Deutsche Bahn has *shut down
  16% of their rail network since the 1990s while focusing on expensive prestige projects* instead of
  maintaining existing infrastructure. They also explain the perverse incentive system where the
  federal government pays for new construction, but DB must fund maintenance from their own budget,
  leading to a preference for fancy new projects over necessary repairs.
  
- *The wind power construction site*
  
  The main problem is again bureaucracy. While one could argue if wind power is good and reliable
  enough for the future, it takes way too many years until a wind turbine is planned and finally
  constructed. The authors detail how Germany's *complex approval processes* involve multiple levels
  of government, with environmental impact assessments, citizen participation procedures, and legal
  challenges that can drag projects out for over a decade. They also discuss how *NIMBY* (Not In My
  Backyard) resistance and inconsistent policies between federal and state levels create additional
  delays, while countries like Denmark have streamlined processes that get turbines online much
  faster.
  
- *The unequal wealth distribution*
  
  Germans have tons of money - we're talking 7.6 trillion euros in private assets. But here's the
  sad news: it's distributed like crazy. The richest 10% own 56% of everything, while half the
  population owns just 1.3% combined. This completely breaks Germany's post-war promise that
  everyone would get their fair share of prosperity. The authors show how this wealth gap is making
  people lose trust in democracy and turn to more {{{zk_book(triggerpunkte,extreme political views)}}} .
  
- *Educational inequality in Germany*

  If you want a good education in Germany, you better hope your parents are educated and wealthy.
  The authors call it a /"lottery of life chances"/. If you grow up in a house full of books with
  parents who help with homework, you should consider yourself lucky. This completely breaks the
  idea that success should come from your own effort, not your family's bank account. Even after all
  those *PISA* reforms, the system still sucks at giving every kid a fair chance.
  
- *The German pension system*
  
  Remember *"Die Rente ist sicher!"* (pensions are secure)? Yeah, right. Many Germans are heading
  straight for poverty in old age. The whole system is basically having young people paying for old
  people right now, but with fewer young people and more old people, this /"generational contract"/ is
  falling apart. 83% of Germans depend on this public pension system, but the benefits keep getting
  smaller while you have to work longer and longer.
  
- *Federalism in Germany*
  
  German *federalism* is basically a reform-killing machine at this point. The *Bundesrat* was supposed
  to be this objective, fact-based counterweight to the political chaos in the *Bundestag*. But after
  75 years? It's become nothing but a (quite unknown) tool for *blocking decisions*. Any reform that
  tries to get through gets either killed completely or watered down to nothing. Take the Bürgergeld
  reform: It passed the Bundestag, but then the Bundesrat just gutted all the important parts. What
  was supposed to be a major reform became just a tiny "Reförmchen" (little reform).
  
As a long-time listener to the podcast, I was already familiar with most topics and arguments. But
having read the book and collecting all the important aspects for each topic, now I always have a
quick reference for each "construction site" problem.
* Philosophy
** 📚 Brief Answers to the Big Questions
Stephen Hawking — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40277241-brief-answers-to-the-big-questions][Goodreads]] • {{{zk_book(brief-answers-to-the-big-questions,Notes)}}}

I had this book on my {{{zk_topic(books/todo/,TODO list)}}} since [[/books/#2022][2022]] already. I don't remember exactly
why I finally decided to read it.

This book contains several chapters which will answer one BIG question such as
- /"Is there a God?"/,
- /"How did it all begin?"/
- /"Is there other intelligent life in the universe?"/
- /"Can we predict the future?"/
- /"What is inside a black hole?"/
- /"Is time travel possible?"/
- /"Will we survive on Earth?"/,
- /"Should we colonize space?"/
- /"Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?"/
- /"How do we shape the future?"/

Overall, Hawking tries to answer these questions from a quite scientific point of view. One thing
that stuck with me was his *explanation of time*: He wrote that the concept of time only exists since
the Big Bang. We simply can't know what was before, because the concept of time didn't exist before.
It's like asking what's south of the South Pole - the question itself doesn't make sense.

** 📚 The Little Book of Stoicism
Jonas Salzgeber — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43621159-the-little-book-of-stoicism][Goodreads]] • {{{zk_book(the-little-book-of-stoicism,Notes)}}}

This was the first book of some initiative I started in order to read more about {{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}}.

The author lists his core principles of {{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}} around what he calls the *"Stoic
Happiness Triangle"*, with *eudaimonia* (living a supremely happy and smoothly flowing life) at the
center as the ultimate goal:

1. *Live with arete* (express your highest self in every moment)

   This includes the four *cardinal virtues*: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Self-Discipline
   
2. *Focus on what you control* (accept whatever happens and make the best of it)
   
   Only focus on your voluntary judgments and actions, everything else is "indifferent"
   
3. *Take responsibility* (get good from yourself)

   Good and bad come solely from yourself, not external events but your interpretation of them

💡 What was even more interesting were the stoic practices which I've used to create [[https://brainfck.org/stoic/?p=36][Daily Stoic
Practice]].

** 📚 The Stoic Mindset: Living the Ten Principles of Stoicism
Mark Tuitert — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127280508-the-stoic-mindset][Goodreads]]

I quite randomly picked this book since I wanted to get really fast into the principles of
{{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}}. This is the place where I first got in touch with the stoic thinking that
there are some /things you CAN control and some you can NOT/. It's also the first time I read about
the key Stoic figures - *Epictetus, Zeno, Chrysippus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius* - and how they
influenced each other (see the section about Marcus Aurelius).

What I found fascinating was Tuitert's story: He's a Dutch Olympic speed skater who discovered
{{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}} just weeks before the 2010 Vancouver Olympics when he was dealing with
massive pressure and self-doubt. After missing two previous Olympics (2002, 2006), he was 29 and
facing what might be his last shot at Olympic glory. All these questions were running through his
head: /"What if I fail miserably? What if I've been training for nothing?"/

That's when he picked up Stoic philosophy, and whether it helped him win gold or not, it completely
transformed how he approached both sports and life afterwards.

💡 The book breaks down {{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}} into *ten practical principles*:

1. Turn obstacles into opportunities (Marcus Aurelius: /"What stands in the way becomes the way"/)
2. Your judgments create emotions, not events themselves
3. Focus only on what you can control
4. Accept what you cannot change
5. Practice negative visualization to prepare for setbacks
6. Live according to your values, not external outcomes
7. Stay present-focused rather than anxious about future/past
8. View yourself as part of something larger
9. Practice gratitude for what you have
10. Remember that virtue is the only true good

Each comes with exercises that Tuitert developed with a sport psychologist. I really liked the
hands-on approach: Instead of just theory, you get things like the "/setbacks practice/" where you
visualize worst-case scenarios to mentally prepare
#+sidenote
This is the Stoic practice of /negative visualization/ that William B. Irvine also teaches in his meditations - it's a core technique for building mental resilience.
#+sidenote
or the ABC model that shows how your emotions come from your judgments about events, not the events
themselves.

What makes this different from other {{{zk_tag(philosophy,philosophy)}}} books is that Tuitert shows how
these ancient ideas actually work in high-pressure situations. He's not just some academic, he's
someone who used these principles to perform under Olympic pressure, then later as an entrepreneur
and father. The Stoics he draws from (especially *Marcus Aurelius, Seneca*, and *Epictetus*) weren't
idle philosophers either - they were leaders dealing with real-world challenges, which is probably
why their ideas still work today.

This was definitely the right book for getting into {{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}} quickly. It's
practical, personal, and shows how these principles can help you stay calm while still being driven
to achieve your goals.
** 📚 How to think like a Roman Emperor
Donald J. Robertson — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863499-how-to-think-like-a-roman-emperor][Goodreads]]

I got this book inspiration from Ryan Holiday who has its [[https://ryanholiday.net/books-courses/][own recommendations]] on
{{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}}.

I particularly liked the style of this book as it's a /narrated version/ of "Marcus Aurelius -
Meditations" (which i still want to read) but way more context / background information in order to
get the bigger picture. It definitely helps to put the actions of *Marcus Aurelius* in the right
historical context in order to understand why several things were done that way.

As a short historical overview:

- Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) was a Roman Emperor who ruled during the height of the Roman Empire,
  but he's most famous for being the last great *Stoic philosopher* of the ancient world. He wasn't
  born to rule - he was adopted at 17 by Emperor Antoninus Pius as part of a succession plan.
  Despite having access to the finest tutors in /rhetoric/, /Platonism/, and /Aristotelianism/, he was
  drawn most deeply to /{{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}}/. Robertson shows how Marcus used Stoic philosophy
  to cope with events that marked his life: managing plague, wars, political intrigue, and personal
  losses (he lost several children). His personal journal, the /Meditations/, wasn't meant for
  publication, it was his private philosophical practice to which he committed regardless of the
  external circumstances.
- His Stoic journey started with *Zeno of Citium* (334-262 BC), a wealthy Phoenician merchant who lost
  everything in a shipwreck and founded {{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}} after discovering Socratic
  philosophy in Athens around 300 BC. The school passed through Cleanthes (a former boxer who
  watered gardens at night), then Chrysippus (who wrote over 700 books and systematized Stoic
  doctrine).

- Centuries later, this reached *Epictetus* (55-135 AD), a former slave who became the most
  influential Stoic teacher of the Roman period. Marcus never met Epictetus personally, but received
  lecture notes from his main tutor *Junius Rusticus*, and Epictetus is the most quoted author in the
  /Meditations/. Marcus essentially saw himself as following Epictetus's version of
  {{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}}.

{{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}} wasn't the only game in town during Marcus's era. The philosophical
landscape was quite diverse. The major schools included /Epicureanism/ (which emphasized pleasure and
withdrawal; Robertson explains how Marcus was trained in multiple traditions but chose
{{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}} because it offered practical wisdom for someone who had to actually rule
an empire while dealing with personal tragedies. The Stoics believed the goal was /"living in
agreement with Nature"/, using reason to live virtuously regardless of external circumstances.

What really impressed me about Robertson's book is how he extracts concrete practices from the
/Meditations/. Marcus didn't just philosophize, he had specific daily techniques/routines:

- /Morning/evening review/: Start each day visualizing challenges and how to respond appropriately, end
  by reflecting on missed opportunities for *virtue*
- /The discipline of judgment/: Describe upsetting events in plain, factual language without emotional
  interpretation ("My car broke down" not "This disaster ruined my day")
- /Dichotomy of control/: Constantly distinguish what's "up to you" (thoughts, values, actions) vs.
  external events you can't control
- /Cognitive reframing/: Ask "How would I view this 10 years from now?" or "What would a wise person
  do here?"
- /The view from above/: Imagine viewing your problems from space or across centuries to maintain
  perspective
- /Memento mori/: Regular death meditations in order to prioritize what truly matters
- /Anger management/: When irritated, wait until the feeling goes away, then try to understand others'
  motives 
- /Negative visualization/: Imagine losing what you have to both appreciate it more and prepare
  mentally for loss

Marcus saw {{{zk_tag(philosophy,philosophy)}}} as some sort of psychological training, like mental
weightlifting to build character strength. Robertson shows how these weren't abstract concepts but
daily practices Marcus used to handle enormous pressure (plague, wars, political conspiracies,
family deaths) while staying true to his principles. I highly recommend this book if you want to get
serious about {{{zk_tag(stoicism,Stoicism)}}}.
* History and Information Networks
** 📚 Nexus
Yuval Noah Harari — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204927599-nexus][Goodreads]] • {{{zk_book(nexus,Notes)}}}

Some years ago I became a big fan of Harari's books after reading
{{{zk_book(21-lessons-for-the-21st-century,21 Lessons for the 21st Century)}}} and then
{{{zk_book(sapiens,Sapiens)}}}. His newest one, {{{zk_book(nexus,Nexus)}}}, is about *information networks* and
the role they've played throughout human history - from ancient myths and bureaucracies to modern
AI.

The book's main argument is that humanity gains power by building large networks of /cooperation/, but
the way these networks are built could lead to /power abuse/. According to Harari it's an "information
problem" that for thousands of years, humans have built and maintained large networks by spreading
fictions, fantasies, and mass delusions about gods, ideologies, and now AI.

Harari introduces two competing views of information:
- the *"naive view"* (more information = more truth = more wisdom) vs.
- the *"populist view"* (information is just a weapon for power)

He argues there's a middle ground between these extremes that could help us handle the AI revolution
more wisely.

What really struck me was Harari's point about *self-correcting mechanisms*, things like independent
courts, free press, peer-reviewed journals. These are what keep democracies healthy by catching and
fixing errors. But here's the thing: the Catholic Church became incredibly powerful precisely
because it had weak self-correction - it didn't allow challenges to its authority (with everyone
else claiming the opposite being punished).

This connects directly to what we're seeing with populists today. They're systematically attacking
the very institutions that make democracies self-correct: calling courts 'corrupt,' the press 'fake
news,' universities 'elite propaganda.' It's like they've learned from history that if you want
unchallenged power, you need to /kill off the error-correction systems/ first.

The AI-democracy stuff is genuinely scary. Harari asks: how can human politicians make financial
decisions when AI increasingly controls the financial system and even the meaning of money depends
on algorithms nobody understands? And how do you have democratic debate when you can't tell if
you're talking to a human or a chatbot?

It's not just about AI taking over, it's about AI making democracy impossible to operate. Democratic
discourse requires knowing who you're actually talking to and having some shared basis for
understanding reality. AI could undermine both of those foundations.

* Health and Spirituality
** 📚 Becoming Supernatural
Joe Dispenza — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35397946-becoming-supernatural][Goodreads]] • {{{zk_book(becoming-supernatural,Notes)}}}

I got into Joe Dispenza after watching some interview he had with Steven Bartlett on [[https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vytnRhdwI8RKcaBwIAnl3]["The Diary of a
CEO"]] podcast. It totally resonated with me, that's why I really wanted to read more about his work
and techniques.

If you're already familiar with {{{zk_tag(breathing,breathing)}}} exercises (like
{{{zk_topic(pranayama,Pranayama)}}} or [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50403522][Wim Hof]] techniques) as well as with some basic spiritual practices,
I *don't* really recommend this book to you. What I didn't like at all about this book was the fact
that Dispenza came up with new names for some breathing exercises (like calling his spinal breathing
technique the /"prana tube"/ method, or referring to chakras as /"energy centers"/) although these have
been around for thousands of years already. In general I didn't like the overall tone as if he
actually discovered most of the meditation/{{{zk_tag(breathing,breathing)}}} techniques.

Dispenza also constantly keeps referring to some of his workshops - his /"Advanced Workshops,"/ /"Week
Long Advanced Retreats,"/ and /"Progressive Workshop Series"/ as if he was trying to sell me
something. I don't really like this because I didn't buy the book to let him convince me that I HAD
to book one of his events in order to get healed.

However, I found some of his explanations interesting (/cerebrospinal fluid/ which will cause an
electromagnetic field around your body when pumped up to the brain) but I found out that Dispenza is
indeed a very *controversial person*. Critics point out that he's actually a chiropractor, not a
neuroscientist as often portrayed, and has published very few peer-reviewed studies. Medical
professionals warn against his pseudoscientific claims and the way he markets meditations as cures
for serious diseases without proper evidence. So each statement has to be digested with some grain
of salt.
* Psychology
** 📚 The Anxious Generation
Jonathan Haidt — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171681821-the-anxious-generation][Goodreads]] • {{{zk_book(the-anxious-generation,Notes)}}}

Having started with {{{zk_book(digital-minimalism,Digital Minimalism)}}} I slowly began to understand how
our *attention* is stolen from us and how much time I actually spent *doom-scrolling* without any
purpose. Well, at least I became aware of this misfortune and drastically changed my relation to
smartphones and social media. The same I cannot speak for the teenagers (and even kids) I sometimes
see in the city, where (although gathered as a group) everyone is staring at their phone, checking
something, without noticing what's going around them.

Jonathan Haidt explores in a more /scientific/ and /empirical/ way why so many teenagers nowadays (and
not only) suffer from /anxiety/, /depression/ and /social isolation/. This also seems to happen on a more
global scale, which according to Haidt cannot be explained by cultural differences, geography,
economic or political events, or even the global financial crisis. *The unprecedented rise between
2010 and 2015 is a sudden, synchronized, international increase in adolescent mental illness that
hit multiple developed nations simultaneously*.

What he calls "*The Great Rewiring*" refers to the period between 2010-2015 when the social lives of
American teens moved largely onto /smartphones/ with continuous access to /social media/, video games,
and internet-based activities. This /Great Rewiring of Childhood/ is what Haidt considers the single
largest reason for the wave of adolescent mental illness that began in the early 2010s.

I had already read Haidt's {{{zk_book(the-righteous-mind,The Righteous Mind)}}} before (covered later in this
post), so I was familiar with his analytical approach to psychological and social phenomena.
But this book really hit different because it's about something we're all witnessing in real time.

💡 Haidt proposes what he calls the *"four foundational reforms"* to protect kids from this mess:

1. No smartphones before high school: Give kids only *basic phones* (calls, texts, maps, music) until
   around age 14
2. No social media before 16: Let their brains develop first before exposing them to the comparison
   and validation-seeking that social media creates
3. Phone-free schools: Schools should have phone lockers or pouches so kids can actually focus and
   interact with each other
4. More independence and free play: Let kids go outside, explore, take risks, and figure things out
   *without constant adult supervision*

What really stuck with me was his *"Mars experiment"* comparison. He calls giving smartphones to Gen Z
/"the largest uncontrolled experiment humanity has ever performed on its own children."/ It's like we
sent them to grow up on Mars - the smartphone/social media environment is fundamentally unsuited to
human child development. Tech companies basically conducted this experiment without research, safety
protocols, parental consent, prioritizing market dominance over child safety (just like tobacco and
oil companies did with leaded gasoline).

** 📚 The Righteous Mind
Jonathan Haidt — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind][Goodreads]]

This book completely changed how I think about {{{zk_tag(politics,politics)}}} and moral disagreements.
Haidt's main argument is pretty radical: we don't think our way to moral conclusions - we *feel* our
way there first, and then our rational mind tries to *justify* what we already "know" is right. He
calls this the "*elephant and the rider*": Your *emotions* are the elephant (massive and in control),
while your *rational mind* is just the tiny rider on top, desperately trying to steer.

Here's how each part works:

The *elephant* (your emotional system):
- Reacts instantly with gut feelings and moral intuitions
- Fast, powerful, and drives most of your behavior unconsciously
- Example: Immediately feeling disgusted by a moral violation or drawn to someone trustworthy

The *rider* (your reasoning mind):
- Acts like the elephant's /lawyer/, crafting arguments to justify what the elephant wants
- Main job isn't objective analysis - it's /post-hoc rationalization/
- Can plan ahead but rarely overrules the elephant's decisions

*Why this matters for moral disagreements:*
- When someone argues against your political views, they're talking to your rider while your
  elephant stomps in the opposite direction
- *Most moral debates fail because you're trying to convince someone's lawyer instead of the real
  decision-maker*
- This explains why logical arguments so rarely change moral opinions

The most eye-opening part was Haidt's "*Moral Foundations Theory*." He argues that while /liberals/
mainly care about harm/care and fairness/justice, /conservatives/ have a broader moral palette that
includes loyalty/betrayal, authority/respect, and sanctity/degradation. This explains why
conservatives often seem to be speaking a completely different moral language. When progressives
focus solely on harm and fairness, they're only hitting 2 out of 5 moral "taste buds" that many
people have.

What really got me was his research on "*WEIRD*" people (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich,
Democratic). Most moral psychology research has been done on college students, but when you study
people from different cultures, you discover that our liberal, individualistic moral framework is
actually the *weird* one globally. Most humans care deeply about group loyalty, respecting authority,
and protecting sacred values - not just individual rights and harm prevention.

The book's structure follows three main parts:
- how moral intuitions work
- why there's more to morality than harm and fairness, and
- how morality both binds groups together and blinds them to other perspectives.

Overall a quite complex book, which took me a while to read. In order to understand Haidt's
positions better I might just watch some Youtube videos.
* Lifestyle and Gardening
** 📚 Kleine Freiheit Garten
Janine Sommer — [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97441361-kleine-freiheit-garten-gl-cklich-im-schrebergarten][Goodreads]]• {{{zk_book(kleine-freiheit-garten,Notes)}}}

This German gardening book turned out to be exactly what I needed: A practical, month-by-month guide
that treats *gardening* as both *sustainable practice* and *personal freedom*.

What I loved most was the /realistic, relaxed/ approach: *"Du musst generell nichts im Garten anbauen,
was du nicht gerne isst"* (/You don't have to grow anything you don't like to eat/). For example the
author admits that mangold doesn't grow well for them and they've never successfully harvested red
beets.

The book is structured around a practical *garden calendar* from March (starting seeds on the
windowsill) through the winter months (minimal care and planning for next year). Each month has
specific tasks, checklists, and seasonal wisdom. March is about anticipation and planning, April is
the first "real" garden month, May focuses on weed management, summer months emphasize watering and
harvesting, and autumn prepares for winter dormancy.

For someone who absolutely had no clue about gardening, this was a quite good start.
* Le Fin

This completes my reading journey for *April through December 2025* where I focus on my own read books
spanning {{{zk_tag(politics,politics)}}}, {{{zk_tag(philosophy,philosophy)}}}, {{{zk_tag(psychology,psychology)}}},
{{{zk_tag(history,history)}}}, and {{{zk_tag(spirituality,spirituality)}}}.
