Continuing with my tradition of quarterly book summaries, here are my reflections on
the books I've read between /October/ and /December/ last year.

* Biographies
** ðŸ“š Elon Musk
ðŸ‘‰ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471711-elon-musk][Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson]]

I must admit I'm definitely *not* a fan of Elon Musk and had some curiosity to learn more
about the person behind the public faÃ§ade. I wanted to learn more about all the aspects
that shaped him and his mindset. As I learned, his childhood and his relationship to his
father have had a profound impact on his thinking and behavioral tendencies.

Overall, I was fascinated by Musk's intelectual breadth which spans multiple domains. He
decided to major in physics because, like his father, he was drawn to engineering. He also
decided to learn about business because he didn't want to work for others:

"I was concerned that if I didn't study business, I would be forced to work for someone
who did," he says. **"My goal was to engineer products by having a feel for the physics and
never have to work for a boss with a business degree."**
#+end_quote

It was exactly this combination of technical depth and business knowledge that would serve
as a fundament for his future ventures. As for his visions he had very concrete
expectations:

He had conceived by then a life vision that he would repeat like a mantra. **"I thought
about the things that will truly affect humanity," he says. "I came up with three: the
internet, sustainable energy, and space travel."** In the summer of 1995, it became clear to
him that the first of these, the internet, was not going to wait for him to finish
graduate school. The web had just been opened up for commercial use, and that August the
browser startup Netscape went public, soaring within a day to a market value of $2.9
billion.

Given our planet's burning challanges (climate crisis, poverty, low education, war) I
still question his Mars colonization plans which are driven by his will to save humanity
and our species once there will be no life possible anymore on Mother Earth. The biography
not only revelead controversial aspects about his visions but also about his leadership
style and work ethics:

#+begin_quote
Musk responded with a very self-aware email. **"I am by nature obsessive-compulsive," he
wrote Fricker. "What matters to me is winning, and not in a small way.** God knows whyâ€¦ it's
probably rooted in some very disturbing psychoanalytical black hole or neural short
circuit."

While he is undoubtly a visionaire and leaded to the success of multiple multi-billion
companies, I still find his management practices problematic: From arbitrary dismissals to
creating unsustainable work environments.
