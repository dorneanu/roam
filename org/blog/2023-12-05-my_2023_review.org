#+TITLE: My 2023 review
#+CREATED: 2023-12-05
#+HUGO_DRAFT: true

I feel somehow ashamed I didn't a review last year. But this year I put some
time aside to reflect on this year's highlights, what I've learned, how I
changed some habbits, how I sticked to some old ones.

* Books
This year I've finally reactivated my [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121423977-victor-dorneanu][Goodreads profile]] mainly for getting
recommendations on what to read next. Although I have my own [[https://brainfck.org/t/books/todo/][TODO list]] which
grows from year to year, I'm always curious to find out what /others/ have read
addtionally after finishing one book.

As always you can find my list of read books at [[https://brainfck.org/books/][brainfck.org/books]] where also
this year I've added tags to the books and restructured the [[https://github.com/dorneanu/roam/blob/main/layouts/books/list.html][Hugo template]] to
list them as well.

Instead of trying to summarize each book
#+begin_sidenote
I like Eli Bendersky's [[https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/book-reviews][Book reviews]]
#+end_sidenote
here are my recommendations for you:

- [[https://brainfck.org/tags/politics/][#politics]]
  - [[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/570367/the-road-to-unfreedom-by-timothy-snyder/][The Road to Unfreedom]] (by [[https://timothysnyder.org/][Timothy Snyder]])

    I've read this book in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58468558-drumul-spre-nelibertate][Romanian]] mainly because I wanted to know more about
    Eastern Europe politics and the on-going war in Ucraine. In his book Synder
    examines the historical and geopolitical aspects that have shaped the world
    recenlty, especially highlighting the actions of Russia and its impact on
    global politics. The book gives the readers insights into the strategies
    used by influential figures (philosophers, politicians etc.) to undermine
    democratic values, manipulate public opinion which all gave birth to
    authoritarianism and the erosion of democracy.

    Although this book offers a deep analysis of the Soviet and Russian
    politics, I think Snyder focussed to much on Russia's actions solely which
    could be interpreted as the primary influences of global authoritarianism,
    the war in Ucraine and fake-news.

  - [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56969567][Mother of Invention: How Good Ideas Get Ignored in an Economy Built for Men]]

    I've chosen this book to be in the top list because it somehow opened my eyes
    for all the gender biases and inequalities that already /have/ existed in our
    society and in the economic world. The author has plenty of (historical)
    examples how women's ideas and contributions often are ignored and
    undervalues, despite their potential to drive innovation and progress. Also
    interesting: Job roles nowadays dominated mainly by men were some decades
    ago preserved for female workers (e.g. computer programming)

    As already mentioned by others, this book serves as a call to action,
    forcing society to address the structural and systemic biases that block
    women's participation and idea recognition in the economy.

  - [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50695158][The Lonely Century: How to Restore Human Connection in a World That's Pulling Apart]]

    The issue of loneliness and social disconnection is something I've been
    observing for years. Despite our inter-connected world with instant
    messaging at our finger tips and a constant influx of events all over the
    world, I think we (as human beings) are suffering from real human
    connections. Also this book serves as a wake-up call to address the
    isolation we're currently facing and provides strong arguments for building
    stronged, more connected communities.

   I have still not processed all thoughts and ideas presented in this book.

First of all a quick recap of [[/2021/12/13/my-2021-review/#outlook][my goals for 2022]]:
- Learning

  2 years ago I wrote I'd like to deep-dive more into *TypeScript*. I still didn't do anything complex in TS but from time to time I still use it (in combination with AWS CDK, like I did for the [[https://github.com/dorneanu/aws-custom-resource-golang][AWS custom resources project]]). I also don't expect this to change as for backend I'd still go for *Golang* (and work-wise I'm "forced" to use Python for small things).

  Besides *TypeScript* I wanted to learn some *Vue.JS*. Back then I wrote:

  #+begin_quote
  I want to be able to build modern frontend applications and use new technologies beyond HTML, CSS and JavaScript :)
  #+end_quote

  I *did* do some frontend but using different technologies: For implementing [[/2022/12/15/releasing-gocial/][gocial]] I've mainly used [[https://alpinejs.dev/][Alpine.js]] and [[https://tailwindcss.com/][Tailwind CSS]]. I still have a course to do on Udemy (regarding *Vue.JS*) but I also need to find time to do it ðŸ™ˆ.

  Among frontend stuff, I was more than motivated to finally learn more about *Web3* (especially *Ethereum*). I did some coding in *Solidity* and also read [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/33584554][Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps]]. Additionally I also learned more about *Smart Contract Security* (I hope to release my notes next year).
