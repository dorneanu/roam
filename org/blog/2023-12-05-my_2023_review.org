#+TITLE: My 2023 review
#+CREATED: 2023-12-05
#+HUGO_DRAFT: true

I feel somehow ashamed I didn't a review last year. But this year I put some
time aside to reflect on this year's highlights, what I've learned, how I
changed some habbits, how I sticked to some old ones.

* Books
This year I've finally reactivated my [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121423977-victor-dorneanu][Goodreads profile]] mainly for getting
recommendations on what to read next. Although I have my own [[https://brainfck.org/t/books/todo/][TODO list]] which
grows from year to year, I'm always curious to find out what /others/ have read
addtionally after finishing one book.

As always you can find my list of read books at [[https://brainfck.org/books/][brainfck.org/books]] where also
this year I've added tags to the books and restructured the [[https://github.com/dorneanu/roam/blob/main/layouts/books/list.html][Hugo template]] to
list them as well.

Instead of trying to summarize each book
#+begin_sidenote
I like Eli Bendersky's [[https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/book-reviews][Book reviews]]
#+end_sidenote
here are my recommendations for you:

- [[https://brainfck.org/tags/politics/][#politics]]
  - [[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/570367/the-road-to-unfreedom-by-timothy-snyder/][The Road to Unfreedom]] (by [[https://timothysnyder.org/][Timothy Snyder]])

    I've read this book in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58468558-drumul-spre-nelibertate][Romanian]] mainly because I wanted to know more about
    Eastern Europe politics and the on-going war in Ucraine. In his book Synder
    examines the historical and geopolitical aspects that have shaped the world
    recenlty, especially highlighting the actions of Russia and its impact on
    global politics. The book gives the readers insights into the strategies
    used by influential figures (philosophers, politicians etc.) to undermine
    democratic values, manipulate public opinion which all gave birth to
    authoritarianism and the erosion of democracy.

    Although this book offers a deep analysis of the Soviet and Russian
    politics, I think Snyder focussed to much on Russia's actions solely which
    could be interpreted as the primary influences of global authoritarianism,
    the war in Ucraine and fake-news.

    ðŸ‘‰ {{{zk_book(drumul-spre-nelibertate/, My own notes)}}} (in Romanian)

- [[https://brainfck.org/tags/society/][#society]]
  - [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56969567][Mother of Invention: How Good Ideas Get Ignored in an Economy Built for Men]]

    I've chosen this book to be in the top list because it somehow opened my eyes
    for all the gender biases and inequalities that already /have/ existed in our
    society and in the economic world. The author has plenty of (historical)
    examples how women's ideas and contributions often are ignored and
    undervalues, despite their potential to drive innovation and progress. Also
    interesting: Job roles nowadays dominated mainly by men were some decades
    ago preserved for female workers (e.g. computer programming)

    As already mentioned by others, this book serves as a call to action,
    forcing society to address the structural and systemic biases that block
    women's participation and idea recognition in the economy.

  - [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50695158][The Lonely Century: How to Restore Human Connection in a World That's Pulling Apart]]

    The issue of loneliness and social disconnection is something I've been
    observing for years. Despite our inter-connected world with instant
    messaging at our finger tips and a constant influx of events all over the
    world, I think we (as human beings) are suffering from real human
    connections. Also this book serves as a wake-up call to address the
    isolation we're currently facing and provides strong arguments for building
    stronged, more connected communities.

   I have still not processed all thoughts and ideas presented in this book.

* Productivity
I usually don't keep track of productivity tools and workflows, as everyone's needs are unique with regards to project / time / resources management. However, I'd like to share some "tools" that have changed the way I work and deal with new initiatives/projects.
** Multi-Scale Planning
As a long time listener of [[https://calnewport.com/podcasts/][Cal Newport's podcast]] of course I had the chance to learn more about his productivity hacks and tipps. Even more than his brilliant advice in {{{zk_book(deep-work,Deep Work)}}} I've found {{{zk_topic(multi-scale-planning,Multi-Scale Planning)}}} to be a true game changer.

While I cannot cover all details (maybe I'll do so in a future post), the main idea is to do planning at *multiple* time scales such as quarterly/monthly, weekly and daily. Each scale has a different level of details as you move from one scale to another.

This approach to /time management/ (because this is what it's about, right?)
allowed me to plan in advance but also be *flexible* whenever something deviated
from the /initial/ plan. This way I was able to come up with some
initiatives/projects for the next quarter/month and define small chunks of work I could do on a weekly/daily level.

âš : TODO Insert some screenshots here

It is a very *visual* system that works well in a digital *and* analog world. No matter which fancy productivity tool you prefer, in the end it's all about the *workflow* and *processes* you implement in order to make consistent progress and contribute to your personal and professional growth.

** Track focus time

I've found /deep work/ (as a state of mind) to be very dificult to achieve. Initially I thought I could train this skill while /meditating/. It did help to some degree but the true deep work killer gadget turned out to be ...my watch. I used my watch to setup a countdown (e.g. 1 hour) which always reminded I should be focussing whenever I've felt I was mind-wandering.

âš : TODO Insert some picture from watch

Often I thought I was focussing for at least 30 minutes when in reality it was only 10 minutes. For me it was a strong indicator my mind was trying to fool me into jumping to other tasks, force me to /procrastinate/.

** Train your visual focus

This is nothing new but still an advice ignored by many. We all know multi-tasking is bad for our attention (and therefore productivity) and to many context switches (switching between different tasks, jump to different windows on your PC) can significantly diminish your ability to focus on one thing.

Some months ago I was listening to Andrew Huberman's podcast on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&ab_channel=AndrewHuberman][How to Focus to Change Your Brain]] where, simply put, he linked our ability to focus to *visual* focus.

He emphasizes that *mental focus* is closely tied to *where* and *how* we focus our eyes. Our visual system can either be unfocused or laser-focused, and this directly impacts our mental focus.

#+begin_quote
What's interesting and vitally important to understanding how to access neuroplasticity is that you can use your visual focus, *and you can increase your visual focus as a way of increasing your mental focus* focus abilities more broadly.

-- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&ab_channel=AndrewHuberman][How to Focus to Change Your Brain (Youtube)]]
#+end_quote

So, Huberman suggests that by sharpening visual focus, we can directly influence *neuroplasticity* which is our ability (or the brain's one) to adapt and learn new information. What's even more important is what exactly you focus on:

#+begin_quote
And the behavioral practices that are anchored in visual focus are going to be
the ones that are going to allow you to develop great depth, and duration of
focus. So let's think about visual focus for a second. When we focus on
something visually, we have two options, we can either look at a very small
region of space, with a lot of detail, and a lot of precision. Or we can dilate
our gaze, and we can see big pieces of visual space with very little detail.
It's a trade off, we can't look at everything at high resolution. This is why we
have these the pupil more or less relates to the phobia of the eye, which is the
area in which we have the most receptors, the highest density of receptors that
perceive light. And so our acuity is much better in the center of our visual
field than our periphery.

-- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&ab_channel=AndrewHuberman][How to Focus to Change Your Brain (Youtube)]]
#+end_quote

In a practical way Huberman advises practicing visual focus at the /specific distance of one hand/, like reading a book or looking at a screen. This means that reading books and therefore engaging your brain into cognitive tasks
#+begin_sidenote
Opposed to reading short articles on the web. Or just skimming the titles.
#+end_sidenote
will definitely have an impact on your capacity to *focus* on a certain thing
for longer periods of time.

At the same time (and this is my own interpretation) I think that keeping your eyes focused on a small region on the screen without further distractions (cat pics, gifs, 10 browser tabs opened) will have the same efect. Obviously I would not have writen this without making my own observations before.

What happened: The more I stick to one window on my laptop without having to switch between apps (e.g. open browser, open mail client) the more focussed I feel. Even if I have to do {{{zk_topic(shallow-work,shallow work)}}} I try to remain in the same context/window. Just to give some
#+begin_sidenote
There are way more to be explored and discussed.
#+end_sidenote
examples:
- I need to add more tasks to a project
  - I just call my capturing system (~org-capture~ in Emacs) to quickly write down a note
- I need to lookup sth on the web
  - From within Emacs I have multiple options:
    - Fire up Google search (using ~xwidget-webkit~)
    - I can use built-in /lookup/ mechanisms for searching
- I need to check my mails
  - I just open ~mu4e~
- I need to ask the AI lords
  - I open ~chatgpt-shell~

* Health
** Tracking
* Software/Tools
Inspired by [[https://daryl.wakatara.com/software-tools-i-use-2023-edition/][Daryl's post]] here's a list of tools and software I've used in 2023:

* Goals

First of all a quick recap of [[/2021/12/13/my-2021-review/#outlook][my goals for 2022]]:
- /Learning/

  2 years ago I wrote I'd like to deep-dive more into *TypeScript*. I still didn't do anything complex in TS but from time to time I still use it (in combination with AWS CDK, like I did for the [[https://github.com/dorneanu/aws-custom-resource-golang][AWS custom resources project]]). I also don't expect this to change as for backend I'd still go for *Golang* (and work-wise I'm "forced" to use Python for small things).

  Besides *TypeScript* I wanted to learn some *Vue.JS*. Back then I wrote:

  #+begin_quote
  I want to be able to build modern frontend applications and use new technologies beyond HTML, CSS and JavaScript :)
  #+end_quote

  I *did* do some frontend but using different technologies: For implementing [[/2022/12/15/releasing-gocial/][gocial]] I've mainly used [[https://alpinejs.dev/][Alpine.js]] and [[https://tailwindcss.com/][Tailwind CSS]]. I still have a course to do on Udemy (regarding *Vue.JS*) but I also need to find time to do it ðŸ™ˆ.

  Among frontend stuff, I was more than motivated to finally learn more about *Web3* (especially *Ethereum*). I did some coding in *Solidity* and also read [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/33584554][Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps]]. Additionally I also learned more about *Smart Contract Security* (I hope to release my notes next year).

- /Reading/

  My reading list for 2022 was:

  #+begin_quote
  - [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22512931-building-microservices][Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems]]
  - [[https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture][Visualise, document and explore your software architecture]]
  - [[https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book][Software Engineering at Google]]
  - [[https://dataintensive.net/][Designing Data-Intensive Applications]]
  - [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28602719-domain-driven-design-distilled][Domain-Driven Design Distilled]]
  - [[https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook][Mastering Ethereum]]
  #+end_quote

  I managed to read {{{zk_book(building-microservices-2nd-edition/,Building Microservices(2nd edition))}}}, {{{zk_book(mastering-ethereum,Mastering Ethereum)}}} and I definitely learned something about [[/2023/11/02/documentation-as-code-for-cloud-c4-model-structurizr/][C4]].

  The rest is still on my {{{zk_topic(books/todo/,TODO list)}}}.

- /Projects/

  Of course there were some ideas and projects I wanted to work on:

  #+begin_quote
  - finish [[https://github.com/dorneanu/access-key-rotator][access-key-rotator]] and release first version
  - clean up my [[https://brainfck.org][Zettelkasten]]
  - start working on my *book*
    - about Golang and Security :)
  #+end_quote

  Well, I did some clean-up on [[https://brainfck.org][brainfck.org]] but this happens on a regular basis. [[https://github.com/dorneanu/access-key-rotator][access-key-rotator]] hasn't been changed since a while and I also did *not* manage to start working on the book about {{{zk_topic(golang,Golang)}}} and Security.

** For 2024

For the up-coming year I'd like to focuss on several things. Continuing in the same scheme I did for my past goals:

- /Learning/
  - Music

    Besides playing the *Djembe* this year I've started learning how to play the *Bongos*. With the help of ChatGPT I was able to read notes again and therefore play some easy to more advanced rhythms on the Bongos. Next year I'd like to keep practicing and get more insights into Latin rhythms (Salsa, Bachata, Merengue, Mambo, Rumba etc.)

- /Projects/
  - Play with {{{zk_topic(htmx,HTMX)}}} and {{{zk_topic(golang,Golang)}}}

    I'd definitely love to do something /front-end/ related and therefore I'd like to play a little bit with [[https://htmx.org/][htmx]]. But first I need an idea for a small application. This way I plan to code again in Golang (this year I didn't manage to code anything useful).

  - Security of Github repositories

    While dealing with /Github/ and the /security settings/ of /repositories/, I wanted to have a small tool at hand which will check for different settings (for each repository in an organization) and report (via Slack, E-Mail) if some settings are not /compliant/.
    #+begin_sidenote
    Obviously there needs to be a list of settings which the tool should check against.
    #+end_sidenote

  - Finish "Documentation as Code" series

    This year I've started writing about several documentation techniques (as code) in my [[/2023/07/18/documentation-as-code-for-cloud/][Documentation as Code]] series. I definitely want to add at least [[https://d2lang.com/][D2Lang]] to it.
