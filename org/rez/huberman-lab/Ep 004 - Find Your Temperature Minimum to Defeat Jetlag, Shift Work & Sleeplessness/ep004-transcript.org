* (00:00:00) Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:
Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science, and
science-based tools for everyday life. [bright music] - I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology, at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to
bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want
to thank today's sponsors of the podcast.

The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that
I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm
delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink
that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the
way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as
well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are
a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain
access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic
Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that,
they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3,
as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important
for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other
biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want
to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they
will send you a year supply of the D3 K2.

This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a
meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and
off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because
meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at
maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter
category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my
meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be
consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out
there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states
can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of
physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a
meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to
learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace,
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will
let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there,
that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app,
for one month for free.

Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to
discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are
going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means
quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can
support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag,
offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier
for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent,
anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc.
If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab
Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and
sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been
discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've
had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will
be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will
provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not
necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you
get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you
digest the information better.

* (00:04:15) The bedrock of sleep-rest cycles
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: the-bedrock-of-sleep-rest-cycles
:ED:
Le's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're
taking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us,
rhthm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24
hor rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a
rhthm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or
no, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but
its been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in
costant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where
peple have been in constant light for some period of time. But because
peple can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment
whre you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the
enogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns
ou we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly
24hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to
hih and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to
reeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have
a hythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We
ted to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we
ted to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This
isa biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have
gees in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on
ths 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the
rof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic
nuleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is
intrained, meaning it is matched, to the external light-dark cycle,
whch is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours.
So our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also
ou metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to
th outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect
wa, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses
th horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at
niht we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly
mached to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do
tht because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this
oter thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk
abut when we get pulled away from that rhythm.

* (00:07:05) Night owls and morning larks
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: night-owls-and-morning-larks
:ED:
No you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night
ows and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their
geetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations
tht make some people want to wake up early and other people want to
sty up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true.
Tht's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's
noescaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were
deigned, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were
costructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I
knw that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain
ofthat because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far
frm a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it
of, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to
arse. I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the
neative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the
neative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you
abut the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the
terible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd
lie to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools.

* (00:08:22) "The perfect schedule"
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: the-perfect-schedule
:ED:
Solet's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's
tak about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push
bak on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe
ba things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling
mierable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the
pefect day? What does that look like from our circadian
slep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in
th three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram
pots. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally
sulight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24
hor cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you
wat to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour
cyle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much
isenough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure
tht you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say
beore, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central
nevous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of
th central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At
lest right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those
nerons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright?
Wel, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your
eys in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so
panful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you
ge up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake,
yo would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead
lihts for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights
wil optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina
tht will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if
thre's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where
yo live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I
lie in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is
thre, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark
whre you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case
yo might want some artificial light. Get some sunlight in your eyes
whn you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I
hae not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of
lu, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover.

* (00:11:04) The 100K Lux per morning goal
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: the-100k-lux-per-morning-goal
:ED:
A ood number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get
exosure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but
beore 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00
AM Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do
no want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very,
vey bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very
imortant, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these
nerons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the
rof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a
vey slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer
sceen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If
I ere to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy
trnsferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be
comunicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's
moning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I
loked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the
prblem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get
enugh light from artificial light before you reach what's called the
cicadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe
1000 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your
eys. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the
pocast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo
reeption. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about
seting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical
helth. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000
htons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish,
mabe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get
nedy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light
Meer and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll
noice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or
5,00 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights
wih eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain
an body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be
7,00, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how
muh photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before
tht 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of
th world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me
pitures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter.
Thn sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get
enugh photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target
toget each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from
arificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight
tht make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's
avilable outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse
me a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a
liht pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause
I' not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this
jut with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you
togle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this
buton, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it
sems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more
phton energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring
lihts that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their
cofee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to
ge sunlight, okay? So those things are kind of nice because they'll
trvel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this
enugh that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the
cicadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again,
tring to achieve kind of perfect schedule.

* (00:15:15) Keeping your biological clock set
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: keeping-your-biological-clock-set
:ED:
Thn I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at
sulight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason
fo that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your
eys because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon
enrgy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian
clck, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it
taes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00
PM And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright
liht and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM
an 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this.
An the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed
ble blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all
tht. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to
adust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit
moe wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens
an overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian
clck. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of
liht early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the
da.

* (00:16:15) Reset your cortisol
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: reset-your-cortisol
:ED:
I'e mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting
th references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going
wih full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal
wih. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and
whn people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their
coments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from
Unversity of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can
eaily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology,
caping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of
waing up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took
grduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset
th melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise
drfted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that
yo can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like
exrcising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same
tie, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described
pefect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes
no all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when
its too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously
soething to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say,
yo're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget
it you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't
wok that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to
ge that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a
bi of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens
orgo to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to
shft your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux
oflight energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's
tak about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this
ablity to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food
isvitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And
thre's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down
toone very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without
an technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or
plasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely
emhasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you
ar jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone
inthe middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at
diferent times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a
kid of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time.
An if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a
nuber of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only
neded four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to
Euope and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability.
An we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I
men, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain
grat lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And
I now some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve
ino a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's
gong to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a
trmendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about
opimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from
pesonal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in
cetain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with
je lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for
th first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble
sleping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back
ono a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it
vaies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you
ca take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it
woked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that
yo can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is
an how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and
beieve, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more
flxibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing
upa PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when
yo can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When
yo understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that
isyour biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of
unerstanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where
were headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised
tht I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can
hapen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.

* (00:21:22) Jetlag, death and lifespan
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: jetlag-death-and-lifespan
:ED:
Thre are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten
yor life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die
ealier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are
may cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially
incountries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the
steet that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that
wa. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this.
Whn I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work
an take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the
en I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total
amesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been
relly jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the
midle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And
tht's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't
deigned to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it
jut wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern
cicadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not
neessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up.
I'e had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in
mod. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at
NY Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I
wan't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just
al over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't
exerience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now
hee's what's interesting.

* (00:23:00) Going East versus West
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: going-east-versus-west
:ED:
Trveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling
eatward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on
logevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life
thn traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new
tie zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is
fa less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour
shft or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we
thnk about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can
shrten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it
tuns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked
beore about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our
spnal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our
slepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are
beter able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their
nevous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push,
an you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later.
Bu falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has
a umber of different features associated with it, that because you're
trveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a
Caifornian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three
hors early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back
toCalifornia and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably
ha roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we
ned to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any
nuber of different things, that we can push ourselves through the
reease of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able
toslow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do.
Sothere's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out
inthe asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because
peple have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper
pulished by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that
taks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus
wetward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different
bilogical markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going
tosleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many
peple have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness.
I' going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous
pocasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is
poentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone.
An I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin
insuppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone
tetosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really
ineresting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right,
wel, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not
gong eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go
frm for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel
Avv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south,
riht? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a
diferent time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel
faigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and
tie zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local
sulight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this
enogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and
to down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple
imortant things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some
peple suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people
exerience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that
beause early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and
flt and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why
thy don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty,
mening it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24
hors, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more
dirupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in
scedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In
adition, there are other things that happen with age that people start
dong less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the
efects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of
th things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are
wiling to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime
toshift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is
inhis 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on
th Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year
ols are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you
hae a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift
yor circadian clock for the sake of jet lag.

* (00:28:45) The key to clock control
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: the-key-to-clock-control
:ED:
An it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting
yor clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your
inernal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one
cold possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps
on of the most important things to know about your body and brain,
whch is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your
aproximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure,
soe of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know
oter things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone
shuld know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't
reuire a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your
teperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your
teperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a
thrmometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your
avrage waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum
teds to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time.
Solet's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30
AM Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you
wat, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum.
Yo can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every
cople hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum.
Wht you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature
miimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up
abut two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into
th afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that
hapens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach
nihttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern.
Sanas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a
thrmogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but
th overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern.

* (00:31:01) Your Temperature Minimum
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: your-temperature-minimum
:ED:
An last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and
oters, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which
ths clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes
al the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule.
Teperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an
imediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these
diferent diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic
cel does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron,
riht? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the
teperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret
th temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their
enironment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are
986, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point,
an you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you
gong to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum
ca be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So
le's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens.
Tae those, add them together, average them by adding them up and
diiding by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're
on of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep
an sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm
clck, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm
clcks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and
mising appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many
peple will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to
soe variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on
lie circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take
tht wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical
teperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature
miimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for
shfting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift
wok, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to
brght light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours
afer your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that
yo will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the
susequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to
red up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you
viw bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature
miimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake
uplater and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because
thre's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time
an all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about
6:0 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was
dong the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means
tht my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM.
Whch means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light
at4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to
be earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent
moning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts
to, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature
miimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes
oran hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six
hors before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to
sty up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent
moning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature
reding. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and
fiure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's
fie. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you
ned to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand
tht in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will
adance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four
hors before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want
tostay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up
ealy and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess
orI feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine. Turns out the
deinition of insomnia is when you're experiencing excessive sleepiness
duing the day. Sleepiness and fatigue are different, okay? So in the
wold of sleep medicine fatigue is a physical exhaustion, sleepiness is
faling asleep. Like falling asleep at your desk or falling asleep
duing lectures, or there seems to be something special about my
letures that makes people want to fall asleep. So if this cures your
inomnia fantastic, however, in all seriousness, sleepiness during the
da time unless it's around your temperature peak and only lasts about
90minutes or so, is a sign of insomnia. It's a sign of lack of sleep. I
wat to be very, very clear that if you know your temperature minimum,
yo can shift your clock using light.

* (00:36:30) Temperature and Exercise
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: temperature-and-exercise
:ED:
Yo can also shift your clock by engaging in exercise in the four hours
afer your temperature minimum to wake up earlier on subsequent nights,
orexercise before then to delay your clock, okay? So now you can start
tosee and understand the logic of the system. And we'll talk about why
ths works and the underlying biology, but understanding that
teperature is the effector and understanding that you have this low
pont that reflects your most sleepy point, essentially right before
waing up, and then temperature rises, you can now start to shift that
teperature according to your travel needs. Here's one way in which you
miht do that. Let's say I am going to travel to Europe, which is nine
hors ahead typically, from California. I would want to determine my
teperature minimum which for me is about 4:30 AM maybe 5:00 AM, and I
wold want to start getting up at about 5:30 AM and getting some bright
liht exposure, presumably from artificial sources because the sunlight
is't going to be out at that time. Maybe even exercising as well, maybe
evn eating a meal at that time if that's in your practice. You would
wat to start doing that two or three days before travel. Because, once
yo land in or I land in Europe, chances are just viewing the sunrise or
suset in Europe is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock.
Soe people say get sunlight in your eyes when you land but that's not
gong to work because one of two things is likely to happen. With a nine
hor shift like that either I'm going to view sunlight at a time that
coresponds to the circadian dead zone, the time in which my circadian
clck can't be shifted, or I'm going to end up viewing sunlight at a
tie that corresponds to the four to six hour window before my
teperature minimum. So it's going to shift me in exactly the opposite
diection that I want to go. So it can be very, very challenging for
peple to adjust to jet lag. So you need to ask, am I traveling east or
amI traveling west? Am I trying to advance my clock or delay my clock?
Reember viewing light, exercise and eating in the four to six hours
beore your temperature minimum will delay your clock. Eating, viewing
sulight, and exercising, you don't have to do all three but some
cobination of those in the four to six hours after your temperature
miimum will advance your clock. And this is a powerful mechanism by
whch you can shift your clock anywhere from one to three hours per day,
whch is remarkable. That means your temperature minimum is going to
shft out as much as three hours, which can make it such that you can
trvel all the way to Europe and in as long as you've prepared for a day
orso by doing what I described back home and then doing it when you
arive, you can potentially accomplish the entire shift within anywhere
frm 24 to 36 hours. And this is really important to emphasize that once
yo arrive in your new location and here I'm talking about traveling
eatward, California to Europe, once you arrive in your new location,
yo have to keep track of what your temperature minimum was back home
an how it's being shifted during your trip. Now it's much easier to do
thn you think. One of the unfortunate consequences of the smartphone is
tht you can't do something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
tht corresponds to the time back home and another one that corresponds
tothe local time. Typically it updates automatically based on wifi,
et. But if you can keep track of the time back home then you can easily
shft your clock going forward. I'm hoping this will makes sense. I
relly want to emphasize that you don't have to be precise down to the
miute. Some of you may be asking, well, what about you've got this
teperature minimum and if I view light one minute before it then I'm
gong to delay my clock and one minute after it I'm going to advance my
clck. It doesn't quite work like that, okay. But it's very important to
unerstand that light is the primary way in which we can shift our
clck. And now you should also be able to understand things like the
cicadian dead zone from about 9:30, 10:00 AM all the way until six
hors before your temperature minimum. You're not going to shift your
clck. Nothing that you do in that time in terms of light viewing
beavior, feeding, etc, is going to shift your clock. And so a lot of
peple are landing in Europe getting sunlight in their eyes and throwing
thir clock out of whack or not shifting their clock at all. This brings
meto the other thing that's highly recommended.

* (00:41:20) Eating
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: eating
:ED:
An I've mentioned this before, but you want to eat on the local meal
scedule. If it's in your practice to fast, fast, that's fine. But when
yo eat, you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness. Okay.
Tht means if you arrive and everyone's eating breakfast and you can't
stmach the idea of breakfast in your new location 'cause your appetite
is't there. That means the clock in your liver, you have a clock in
yor liver, biological clock, has not caught up to the new time zone.
Yo can force yourself to eat if you like, or you can skip that meal.
Bu what you don't want to do is stay on your home meal schedule, waking
upin the middle of the night and eating. That is really going to throw
thngs off because a lot of the clocks in the periphery like from the
lier, the peripheral body, will send information back to the brain and
thn the brain is getting really conflicted signals. So the temperature
miimum is really your anchor point for shifting your clock best. I
do't know why this information really hasn't made it into the popular
spere, quite so much. There's all sorts of stuff about taking things
lie melatonin, using binaural beats, a lot of kind of like more
sohisticated, complicated, and potentially problematic ways of trying
toshift the clock. Let's talk about melatonin but first I just want to
pase and shift gears a little bit because I talked about traveling
eatward, but we haven't talked about traveling westward.

* (00:42:50) Go West
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: go-west
:ED:
SoI want to do that now. Let's say you're traveling from New York to
Caifornia or from Europe to California. The challenge there tends to
be how can you stay up late enough? Now, some people are able to do
ths because as I mentioned earlier, the autonomic nervous system is
asmmetrically wired such that it's easier to stay up late later than we
wold naturally want to than it is to go to sleep earlier. So let's say
yo land and it's 4:00 PM and you're just dying, you're in California,
yo came from Europe, it's 4:00 PM and you really, really want to go to
slep. That's where the use of things like caffeine, exercise, and
sulight can shift you, right? If it's after your temperature peak then
viwing sunlight around 6:00 PM or 8:00 PM or artificial light, if there
is't sunlight, will help shift you later, right? It's going to delay
yor clock and you're going to be able to stay up later. The worst thing
yo can do is take a nap that was intended to last 20 minutes or an
hor. I do this routinely and then wake up four hours later or you wake
upand it's midnight and you can't fall back asleep. You really want to
avid doing that. So provided it's not excessive amounts, stimulants
lie caffeine and coffee or tea can really help you push past that
afernoon barrier and get you to sleep more like on the local schedule.
An eating on the local schedule as well.

* (00:44:15) Pineal myths and realities
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: pineal-myths-and-realities
:ED:
A umber of people have asked about the use of melatonin to induce
slepiness. All right, well let's think about what melatonin is.
Meatonin is this hormone that's released from the pineal gland, which
isthis gland. A couple of notes about the pineal, 'cause I've been
geting a lot of questions about this. I'm probably going to draw some
fie for this but I'd be happy to have a thoughtful, considerate debate,
wih some peer reviewed papers in front of us. The pineal does make this
halucinogenic molecule they call DMT, but in such a minuscule amounts
tht it is not responsible for the hallucinations you see in sleep and
draming. Sorry, folks. It's also not responsible for the hallucinations
yo might see through other approaches to DMT. It's just not, that's not
whre the DMT comes from. It's infinitesimally small amounts. There are
a ot of kind of wacky claims out there about calcification of the
pieal and fluoride and this kind of thing. Look, the pineal sits in an
ara of the brain near the fourth ventricle, where the skull is not
teribly far away although there's some overlap in neural tissue and
wih age there's some aggregation of some of the meninges and other
thngs around there that stick to the skull. Young brains don't look
lie old brains but there's no calcification of the pineal, all right?
Soyou can forget about calcification of the pineal as a problem. I
do't know where that whole thing got started but that's not an issue.
Yor pineal will churn out melatonin your whole life. Melatonin induces
slepiness. Melatonin during development is also responsible for timing
th secretion of certain hormones that are vitally important for
puerty. Does melatonin control the onset of puberty? Not directly, but
inirectly. Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing
homone, which is a hormone that's released from your hypothalamus also
roghly above the roof of your mouth in your brain.
Goadotropin-releasing hormone is really interesting 'cause it
stmulates the release of another hormone called luteinizing hormone,
whch in females causes estrogen to be released within the ovaries, it's
inolved in reproductive cycles, and in males stimulates testosterone
frm the sertoli cells of the testes. Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH,
goadotropin-releasing hormone, and therefore is inhibitory to LH,
lueinizing hormone, and therefore is inhibitory to testosterone and
esrogen. There's just no two ways about it. There is immense amount of
daa on the fact that high levels of melatonin in seasonally breeding
anmals, takes the ovaries from nice and robust ovaries that are capable
ofdeploying eggs and this kind of thing and literally shrinking them
an making these animals infertile. These are very high levels of
meatonin in seasonal breeders in winter. Melatonin in males of seasonal
breders takes the testes and shrinks them. Long ago when I was at UC,
Bekeley as a master's student, I was working on neuroendocrinology, and
wewere working on this hamster species of seasonal breeders. And
baically when days are long, which inhibits melatonin, these little
Sierian hamsters as they're called, have testes about the size of, sort
oftypical table grapes, although that's a weird way to put it. When
das get shorter and the melatonin signal gets longer because light
inibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin gets longer. Those same
hasters would have testes that would involute to the size of about a
grin of rice. Now this does not happen in humans in short days. But
noetheless, the melatonin signal really does have a ton of effects on
th hormone system. Now, does that mean that if you've been taking
meatonin you've really screwed up your hormones? Not necessarily. Does
itmean if a kid has been taking melatonin that's really screwing up
thir puberty? Not necessarily and here's why. Melatonin operates on a
cocentration level. So in a child that's very, very small that has high
leels of melatonin, it actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone or
esrogen depending on the sex of the child. But as that child grows
though other mechanisms, like growth hormone release, etc, that same
amunt of melatonin released from the pineal is now diluted over a much
lager body so that the concentration actually goes way, way down, okay?
Bu here's the problem with supplementing melatonin. As I mentioned in
th previous episode, concentrations of melatonin in many commercial
suplements have been shown to be anywhere from 85% to 400% of what's
lited on the bottle. So when you take melatonin or a child takes
meatonin oftentimes they are taking super physiological levels of
meatonin, which at least by my read, and the literature, says that it
cold have dramatic effects on timing and course of things like puberty.
Soit's not so much that the journals have come out saying, oh, taking
tht melatonin inhibits puberty, it's that no single study has been done
wih the super physiological levels of melatonin that are present in a
lo of these supplements in developing children. So melatonin is used
wiely for inducing sleepiness when you want to fall asleep in the new
loation that you've arrived, right? You can't fall asleep, you take
meatonin, it helps you fall asleep. It does not help you stay asleep.
Inaddition to that, melatonin has been kind of touted as the best way
toshift your circadian clock. I'm happy to go on record saying, look,
ifyou need melatonin, you can work with a doctor or somebody who really
unerstands circadian and sleep biology go for it, if that's your thing.
Bu I, as always on this podcast and elsewhere, I have a bias toward
beavioral things that you can titrate and control like exposure to
liht exercise, temperature, etc, that have much bigger margins for
saety and certainly don't have these other endocrine effects that we've
ben thinking about and talking about. So if you want to take melatonin
inthe afternoon in order to fall asleep or in the evening, be my guest,
tht's up to you. Again, you're responsible for your health, not me. But
fo many people melatonin is not going to be the best solution. The best
soution is going to be to use light and temperature, and exercise on
eiher side of the temperature minimum to shift your clock both before
yor trip and when you land in your new location and your clock starts
toshift. Okay, so now you know my opinions about melatonin, feel free
tofilter them through your own opinions and experiences with melatonin.
An now you also understand what your temperature minimum is and how it
reresents an important landmark either side of which you can use light,
teperature, and exercise to shift your clock.

* (00:51:13) The Heat-Cold Paradox
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: the-heat-cold-paradox
:ED:
Jut to remind you a little bit about temperature, if you want to shift
yor clock, typically you would do that by you can take a hot shower and
thn that will have a cooling effect after the hot shower. And if you
wee to get into a cold shower or an ice bath if you have access to one,
aferward there's going to be a thermogenic effect of your body
inreasing temperature. And if you just think about your natural rhythm
bak home when everything's stable, you have an idea a low point in
whch is your temperature minimum, and then you have a peak, and you
thnk about when you're doing this hot or cold shower in that rhythm,
no you should be able to understand how you're shifting your rhythm.
Tht temperature rhythm is the one that's going to move. Give you an
exmple. If I were to wake up in the morning and let's say I wake up at
6:0 AM. My temperature I know is rising, I've passed my temperature
miimum. If I were to get into a hot shower, that would then lower my
boy temperature when I got out, that is not normally what's happening
fist thing in the morning, and therefore my clock would very likely get
phse delayed, right? It's going to delay the increase in temperature.
Whreas if I got into a cold shower, something I don't personally like
todo, but I've done from time to time or an ice bath that's going to
thn have a rebound increase in body temperature and is going to phase
adance my clock. That peak in the afternoon is going to come about an
hor earlier. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier, later that night.
Soyou can start to play these games with timing and hot and cold, with
mels whether or not you eat, or you don't eat, and with light exposure,
whther or not you view light or you don't view light. So now you can
strt to see why understanding the core mechanics of a system can really
gie you the most flexibility because I could spend the next 25 years of
mylife answering every question about every nuance pattern of travel.
Wel, we're going to Sydney and then we're going there, what should I
do But that's on you. You need to figure out your temperature minimum
an your temperature peak, if you like, and then use these parameters to
itgives you flexibility. And that really underscores the most important
thng is that when you understand mechanism it's not about being
nerotically attached to a specific protocol, it's the opposite. It
gies you power to not be neurotically attached to a specific protocol.
Itcan give you great confidence and flexibility in being able to shift
yor body rhythms however you want. And when things get out of whack you
ca tuck them right back into place. One thing that's common is that
peple need to do a quick trip. It's not always that you're going to go
to you know on vacation for two weeks or, you know, work someplace else
fo weeks on end.

* (00:53:45) Staying on track
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: staying-on-track
:ED:
Ifyour trip is 48 hours or less, stay on your home schedule. This can
betough and it may require scheduling meetings according to your home
scedule, but if you can somehow manage that the best thing to do would
beto stay on your home schedule. Your clock is not going to shift more
thn a couple hours, even if you do everything correctly in one day,
oky? So if I were to travel, say to Europe, I've actually done this, I
di a 24 hour trip to Basel, Switzerland, gave a talk and came back,
peple thought I was crazy but, I had a little bit of travel fatigue
'cuse remember there's fatigue from the actual travel experience. The
noelty of it, the air is never great on the planes, this was even true
beore there were mask requirements and things like that. There's the
trvel fatigue but you don't throw your clock off. If you stay 48 hours,
thn you start to shift a little bit. 72, that's when you start running
ino trouble. The transit time is also important but I would say if it's
thee days or less, stay on your home schedule as much as you can. And
beause sunlight isn't under your control unless there's something about
yo I don't know, that's when traveling with some sort of bright light
lie the light pad that I have down there that I showed earlier, for
thse of you listening just on audio, it sort of looks like an eight and
a alf by 11 inch pad. It's actually not designed for wake up, it's
acually designed, it's a drawing pad, and it emits about 1,000 lux of
liht. And so if you want to travel with something like that, you can
us that in your hotel room to wake up when you like.

* (00:55:30) Nightshades
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: nightshades
:ED:
Soe people will use night shades, you know, not the night shades that
yo eat or that some people say you're not supposed to eat, I don't know
anthing about that, but the eye covers to keep light out. Those can be
vey useful on planes and in hotels and so on. So you can use light and
dak or you can travel with your light and dark devices so that you can
sty on your home schedule and get most of your light when it would be
yor normal wake up time back home. And what's kind of nice is if you
knw when your circadian dead zone is back home, which is generally for
mot people around 10:00 AM to about 3:00 PM, so basically the rising
phse of your temperature, then you can also feel free to be outside
wihout having to wear sunglasses or you don't have to worry about light
exosure. But if you know that window before your temperature minimum,
tht four to six hour window, that's the time when if you're viewing a
lo of light in your new location, you are going to shift your clock
prtty considerably and then you can come back home and have a terrible
tie. At the end of graduate school, I went to Australia, remarkable
contry, incredible people, incredible wildlife, had amazing time, I
cae back and it was the first time in my life where I couldn't sleep on
a egular schedule. I was sleeping in like hour long increments
thoughout the day, it was a nightmare. And it took me weeks to get back
ontarget. And the way I was able to do that was exercising consistently
atthe same time every 24 hours, turning my home into essentially a cave
atnight, even covering up the windows and then getting as much bright
liht in my eyes as I possibly could during the day, no sunglasses, etc.

Soit can take some real work if your clock gets thrown out of whack.
Thre's a phenomenon called ICU psychosis, where people that are in the
inensive care unit in hospitals actually lose their mind. They become
pschotic, hallucinations, etc. And it's because of altered circadian
cyles. We know this 'cause they're exposed to these lights and these
sonds, people coming in and checking on them.

Thy leave the hospital or in some cases, there have been experiments
whre people are placed near a window where they get some natural light
an the psychotic symptoms disappear, presuming there weren't psychotic
syptoms beforehand, before they entered the hospital. So it's pretty
drmatic what light can do to the psyche and to the body. So let's talk
a ittle bit about a different form of jet lag that requires no planes,
notrains, no automobiles, and that's shift work.

* (00:58:05) Shift work
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: shift-work
:ED:
Shft work is becoming increasingly common. Many of us are shift working
evn though we don't have to. We're doing work in the middle of the
niht, we are, you know, working on our computers at odd hours, sleeping
duing the day. A lot of people who are under shelter and place type
stff, are doing more of this. Kids with the drifting school schedules.
Hee's the deal with shift work. If there's one rule of thumb for shift
wok, it's that if at all possible, you want to stay on the same
scedule for at least 14 days, including weekends. Now that should
imediately cue the non shift workers to the importance of not getting
to far off track on the weekend, even if you're not a shift worker. So
sleping in on Sunday is not a good idea. The most important thing about
shft work is to stay consistent with your schedule. Now, I had a
coversation on an Instagram live with Samer Hattar, who's a
neroscientist at the National Institutes of Mental Health, he's
acually the head of the chronobiology unit there. And he was really
emhasizing this point because shift work where people are doing the
socalled swing shift, where they're working four days on one shift and
for days on or another, is extremely detrimental to a number of health
paameters. It gets the cortisol release from the adrenals really out of
whck. And there're these cortisol spikes at various hours of the day,
itmesses up learning, it really disrupts the dopamine system and
welbeing. It is a serious, serious problem. So if you can negotiate
wih your employer to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time,
tht's going to be immensely beneficial and will help you offset a lot
ofthe negative effects of shift work. Now, I don't presume that all of
yo are going to be able to do that. Some of you just don't have that
leel of control. And of course, I want to acknowledge that shift
wokers are essential, right? Of course, first responders, firefighters,
poice officers, paramedics, etc, but also pilots, night nurses, people
woking on the hospital wards, people picking up trash. These night
shfts are critical to our functioning as a society, as I'm sure all of
yo can appreciate. If you're going to work a shift where let's say, you
strt at 4:00 PM and you end at 2:00 AM, excuse me, then there's some
imortant questions that arise. For instance, should you see light
duing your shift? Well, this is a matter of personal choice but ideally
yo want to view as much light as possible and as is safely possible
whn you need to be alert. So that would mean from 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM
an then you would want to sleep. So using light as a correlate of
alrtness and using darkness as a correlate of sleepiness, what this
mens is see as much light as you safely can during the phase of your
da when you want to be awake. So it's the same thing I said way back at
th beginning of this podcast episode. And see as little light as safely
posible and it allows you to function during the time when you want to
beasleep. So if you're finishing out that 2:00 AM shift, that's when
yo would want to avoid bright light exposure, you'd want to go home,
yo'd really want to avoid watching TV if possible. If you need that in
orer to fall asleep, that would be a case where something like dimming
th screen, plus blue blockers, if that's in your practice or you want
todo that would be helpful and then going to sleep and then you'll
prbably wake up late in the afternoon or early afternoon. Some of you
miht say, wait, Huberman, I thought you don't like blue blockers. I
neer said I don't like blue blockers. I don't like people wearing blue
blckers at the time of day when they want to be alert. And I don't like
peple asserting that blue blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply
beause people are wearing them. The brightness of light is what's
imortant it's not about the blue. So if you want to wear them, wear
thm, or just dim the lights or turn the lights off. So let's say you go
tosleep at, you get home after this 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM shift, you maybe
ea something, you go to sleep, and you wake up and it's noon or 1:00
PM Should you get light in your eyes? Well, your first assumption based
onwhat I've said previously might be that you're in the circadian dead
zoe that you can't because it's noon 1:00 PM. But you're not in the
cicadian dead zone because you're somebody who goes to sleep early in
th morning at 2:00 AM. So it's not like the circadian dead zone is a
stict time of day, it's an internal biological clock. So what do you
ned to know?

* (01:02:40) The Temperature-Light Rule
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: the-temperature-light-rule
:ED:
Yo guessed it, you need to know your temperature minimum. You need to
knw whether not your temperature is increasing or decreasing. And now
wecan make this whole thing even simpler and just say, if your
teperature is decreasing, avoid light. If your temperature is
inreasing, get light. It's that simple, okay? If your temperature is
dereasing, avoid light, if your temperature is increasing, get light.
Th shift worker who works from 4:00 PM until 2:00 AM has a temperature
rhthm that's very different than mine where I wake up around 6:00 AM,
5:0 AM, and I go to sleep around 11:00 PM, okay? We both have a 24
hor-ish circadian cycle, except mine is more aligned to the rise and
seting of the sun and there's is not, right? So you have to know your
inernal temperature rhythm. And no you don't have to walk around with a
thrmometer wherever, taking your temperature. Although it'd be great if
soe of the devices that are out there, you know, people are counting
thir steps, I think it'd be great if people had a circadian body
teperature measurement. I'm not involved in any of this device
deelopment but I think it's a real call to arms, pun intended, to have
a ristband that would measure temperature and would tell you your
teperature minimum when you travel or whatnot. I don't know, maybe some
ofthese devices already do that. But if they don't, they should. It's
abolutely absurd to me why we wouldn't have the simple measurement,
vey easy to get that kind of information. You don't even need the exact
teperature read all you need to know is the high and low point. So
le's say you're a shift worker who really is nocturnal, you're flipped.
Wel, you want to stay on that nocturnal schedule. Now that can be very
had on families and social life of all kinds.

* (01:04:20) Up all night: watch the sunrise?
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: up-all-night-watch-the-sunrise
:ED:
Bu the person who is working say from, you know, 8:00 PM, like sundown
tosunrise, this raises a question. Should they be looking at the
surise and should they be watching the sunset? Waking up with a sunset,
gong asleep at the sunrise. You think, well, is that light going to
thow them off? Ah, probably not. It's just actually going to invert
wht sunrise and sunset are. When they're waking up in the morning, if
thy look at the, you know, they get some sunlight in their eyes, they
lok at the sun and get some bright light from devices or overhead
lihts in their apartment or home, well, that's going to tend to wake
thm up if it's in the evening, right? So it's, you know I don't know if
I tated that clearly, but if in the evening the sun is setting and
thy're looking at that setting sun, that is the morning sun for that
peson and it will wake them up for their night shift. So temperature
riing. Then toward morning, what's happening? Okay, well, they're
clsing out their work shift. You're going home, the sun is rising. Do
yo look at the rising sun? Well, based on what you now know your eyes
ar very sensitive to resetting of circadian clocks. What will it do at
tht time? If this were a classroom, I would either cold call on
soebody or I'd wait for the oh, oh, oh, oh person in the audience that
invitably exists. So temperature is for that person, they've been up
fo a while, temperature is falling, not rising. For me it will be
riing. But 'cause I'm diurnal, I'm awake during the day. For that
peson the temperature's falling and so they view light while
teperature is falling. What's it going to do? It's going to phase delay
thm. It's going to make it harder for them to get to sleep the
folowing night. So you would say that person should watch the setting
su to help them wake up 'cause they're going to work the night shift,
bu should probably have sunglasses on or avoid viewing bright light
beore they go to sleep. So it's the same thing. They're just on an
inerted as a typical person who's diurnal, but they're on an inverted
scedule. And so I'm really trying hard here to make this all really
clar. There are kind of two patterns of requests in the world I'm
noicing as I've kind of ventured into the this landscape of social
meia and podcasts.

* (01:06:45) Error correction is good
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: error-correction-is-good
:ED:
Thre are people who want to know every detail and want to quantify
evrything 'cause they want to get exactly right. These are like the
grduate students and students that don't want to make a mistake. And to
qute my graduate advisor, provided the mistakes are not dangerous,
cetainly not lethal, you kind of want to make a few little mistakes so
tht you can adjust, right? You don't want to endanger yourself. But
its actually, you're not going to get things perfect, that's called
lerning. Learning is when you realize, ah, I viewed the sun this time
an then I stayed up and it really messed me up, I'll never do that
agin. The other category of people seem to want the one size fits all
kid of like give me this pill or give me this protocol. And those
thngs generally work but they don't afford people flexibility. And if
thre's anything like that, it's this temperature minimum thing that
I'e been just hammering on again and again and again today because it's
soething that you own and that you can really use as a key landmark for
shfting your clock. I suppose there's a third category, which is,
peple accept that biological systems are actually much more forgiving
thn the way they're sometimes described. And I'm going to use this as
anopportunity to editorialize a little bit. You know, there's so much
mae of sleep debt. Look there isn't an IRS equivalent for sleep.
Thy're not going to come around and try and collect all the sleep that
yo didn't get. No one really knows what the consequences are going to
befor you and for me and for the next person for the sleep you didn't
ge. You can't really recover the sleep you missed out on, but you also
do't want to get neurotically attached to a schedule because there's
ths thing called sleep anxiety and then people have trouble falling
aseep and staying asleep.

* (01:08:20) NSDR protocols/implementation
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: nsdr-protocolsimplementation
:ED:
SoI want to spend a moment on that and go back to a theme that I've
sad many times before, because these tools work what I called NSDR,
no-sleep deep rest. So this would be hypnosis, I gave you the link, but
I'l say it again, reveriehealth.com for clinically tested, research
teted free hypnosis for anxiety but also for sleep. Those are very
beeficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols for
thngs like yoga nidra, I provided some links to those in the caption
fo episode two. These things really work. Last night, I woke up, I went
tobed about 10:30, I woke up at three in the morning, I knew I wasn't
feling rested. I did a NSDR protocol, I fell back asleep, I woke up at
6:0, okay. You need to teach your brain and your nervous system how to
tun off your thoughts and go to sleep. And ideally you do that without
meication unless there's a real need, you do that through these
beavioral protocols. They work because they involve using the body to
shft the mind not trying to just turn off your thoughts in the middle
ofthe night. Now there are periods of life where things are stressful
an people are concerned and you will have some struggle getting and
stying asleep. And there's, that really has to do more with anxiety
whch NSDR protocols also can help with. As I always say, do them in the
midle of the night if you wake up and you want to go back to sleep
duing the middle of the day, to teach your nervous system to calm down
an do them first thing in the morning if you didn't feel you got enough
slep. In other words, do them whenever you have an opportunity to do
thm because they really can help you learn how to turn on the
paasympathetic/calming arm of your autonomic nervous system. There's no
oter way that I'm aware of to teach your system to slow down and turn
of your thoughts and go back to sleep. But these are powerful
prtocols, and there's a lot of research now to support the fact that
thy can really help. Meditation would be another example. Certain kinds
ofmeditation involve focus and alertness. Those are slightly different
thn meditations that involve lack of focus and attention to say
inernal states. I'm going to pause there, and then I want to talk about
kis and the elderly. In other words, how do we control sleep and
cicadian rhythms and wakefulness in babies, adolescents, teens, and
agd folks.

* (01:10:44) The frog skin in your eye (not a joke)
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: the-frog-skin-in-your-eye-not-a-joke
:ED:
Al right, before we talk about sleep in kids, I want to tell a little
stry. It's not a joke, many of you will be relieved that I'm not going
totry and tell another joke this episode. Which is the relationship
beween light, skin and pelage color, dopamine and reproduction, mating.
Somany seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters which I mentioned
ealier, rabbits, fox, other animals, change their color of their coat.
Inthe winter they tend to be a lighter color, sometimes pure white,
soetimes with flecks of black or brown. And in the summer their pelage
chnges to a color of you know, brown or red, some other vastly
diferent color. That shift is controlled by light and by melatonin.
Ths has an interesting correlate in humans. So humans obviously have
diferent skin tones just genetically because of the amount of melanin
inone skin, depending on genetic background. But of course sunlight
wil increase the amount of melanin in the skin regardless, right? This
issuntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. The whole system is wired
sothat shifts in skin color and shifts in these cells within the eye
an melatonin are actually very closely linked. So here's the story.
May years ago, meaning about 10 years ago, 15 years ago, let's see it
wa 20 years ago, forgive me. A guy named Iggy Provencio who was running
hi own lab at uniformed armed services, this is a standard biological
laoratory, discovered that there was an opsin in the eye in the cells
ofthe eye that connect to the rest of the brain called melanopsin.
Meanopsin, as many of you now know is the opsin, it's like a pigment,
itabsorbs light. It is the opsin that converts light into electrical
sinals to then set the circadian clock. Iggy discovered melanopsin
beause it was similar in form to what was in frog melanophores. It was
acually in the skin of frogs that allowed those frogs to go from pale
whte, when it was dark, for most of the 24 hour cycle, to pigmented
gren or brown for a frog. So there's this relationship between the
cels in our eye and the pigment cells of our skin. And we also know
tht in long days, there's more breeding. How does that work? Well
tht's actually from dopamine triggering increases in testosterone,
manly in males, and estrogen mainly in females although of course,
thre's testosterone estrogen in both sexes. So we have this kind of
pahway where it's light, increases in the melanin, dopamine and
reroduction on the one hand and lack of light, melatonin, decreases in
th darkness of skin, less melanin in the skin, or in the case of an
anmal with fur, white fur and no reproduction on the other hand. And
huans don't actually shift their breeding patterns tremendously from
log days and short days, although there are some data that there's some
shfts. We also don't radically change our skin color depending on how
muh sunlight exposure we have. But the simple way to put this is, when
das are long, there's a lot more dopamine and we feel really good and
thre's a lot more breeding and breeding-like behavior. When days are
shrt, there's a lot less dopamine and a lot less breeding behavior
beause these pathways are very highly conserved. Now what's interesting
isthat, as we've moved into a modern society where much of our waking
das we are looking at screens, which is fine, 'cause we're getting a
lo of light that way although not as much as sunlight. But also at
niht, we're getting a lot of light from screens. What's happened is all
thse path ways, melanin in the skin, turnover of skin cells, dopamine,
al of this stuff has become completely disrupted. Now that's not to say
tht we should go back to a time in which we didn't use artificial
lihts. But I think the important thing to realize is that feeling good
wih getting a lot of light, the relationship to dopamine and melanin in
th skin, and the good feelings of getting light also on our skin
prvided you're not getting burned or you're not getting excessive UV
exosure, those are not just coincidences. Those are hard-wired
bilogical mechanisms that exist in everybody regardless of how light or
dak your skin is to begin with. There's another point, which is
imortant, which is that the dopamine system which is this feel-good
moecule is very closely related to the testosterone and estrogen in
reroductive cycles. Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing
homone, luteinizing hormone, and the production of these hormones, and
meatonin is the effector. It is the hormone of darkness. So, I just
thew a lot of biology at you. And I'm not saying you're like a Siberian
haster, at least not in ways that I'm aware of. I'm not saying that
yor pelage color is going to change.

* (01:16:39) Why stress turns your hair white
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: why-stress-turns-your-hair-white
:ED:
Acually the reason people go gray is because when you're really
stessed, did you know this, that when you're really stressed, there's
anincrease in the nerve fibers that release adrenaline to the hair
folicle and that activates peroxide groups in the hair follicle that
case the hair to actually go gray or white. So actually stress does
mae your hair gray or white. Aging does it too. That was a brief aside,
bu for those of you that are interested in the relationship between
liht and skin tone and all that kind of stuff, I thought you might find
itinteresting that the cells in your eye are a lot like these skin
cels in frogs or in animals that shift their entire color and sometimes
meamorphosize. You know, there are some species that literally change
shpe in their reproductive organs.

* (01:17:24) Ovaries or testes?
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: ovaries-or-testes
:ED:
Infact, if that wasn't weird enough, when I was in graduate school at
Bekeley, there was another graduate student studying a species of
hemaphroditic mole, right, those little things that dig, hermaphrodite
moe that would change from having ovaries to testes and back again
deending on day life. Super cool, super different, and wild biological
mehanism. If you're wondering how those animals reproduce they actually
adust the numbers of males and females depending on the density of
maes and females. So if there are too many males, some of the males
tun their testes into ovaries. And if there're too many females, they
tun their ovaries into testes. They actually are true hermaphroditic
anmals as opposed to as pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay, let's get
bak on track. Let's talk about the animal that most of you care about
whch is the human animal. New parents and babies.

* (01:18:25) Babies and bright light
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: babies-and-bright-light
:ED:
Al right, as I mentioned earlier, melatonin is not cyclic, it's not
cyling in babies, it's more phasic. It's being released at a kind of a
costant level. And babies tend to be smaller than adults, they are. And
sothose concentrations of melatonin are very high. As the baby grows,
thse concentrations per unit volume are going to go down. Babies are
no born with a typical sleep wake cycle. And now all the parents are
saing, tell me something I didn't know. They also have, and I really
wat to emphasize this, they also have much more sensitive optics of the
ey. So a number of people have asked me, you know, should I be exposing
mybaby to sunlight? You don't want to avoid sunlight, but their eyes
ar very sensitive, the optics of their eyes aren't quite developed so
muh so that you know when you look at a newborn baby and they look a
litle glassy-eyed and they're kind of looking through you or even a
yong child. A lot of people think that they're seeing you the way that
yo're seeing them. Hate to break it to you, but if you ever can just
gogle visual image of a like a one month old. The optics of their eyes
ar so poor that you're a cloudy image. They're not seeing your fine
deail. As the optics get better, then they will see you with more and
moe clarity. But a lot of that is clearing of the lens and some of the
oter aqueous features of the newborn eye, they don't see very well. But
thy also don't have such great ways of adjusting to bright light. And
sobabies have a natural aversion to bright lights. So you really want
toavoid trying to use sunlight or really bright light in the same way
tht you would for an adult on a young baby or child. As children get
oler however, melatonin does start to become slightly more cyclic,
slghtly more cycled, and their body temperature rhythms also start to
fal into a more regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm, they're more of
thse ultradian rhythms. So in episode, I think it was one or two of the
pocast, or maybe both, we talked about these 90 minute so-called
ulradian rhythms, where every 90 minutes babies are going through a
cyle of body temperature and some other hormonal features. I mean, so
muh is changing in their system. So what to do if a child isn't
sleping? You can use phases of darkness and phases of light but they're
gong to have to be shortened in order to try and encourage sleep when
yo want the child to sleep. It's not that they're just not going to
fal into an adult-like regime of a temperature minimum and a
teperature maximum. Their temperature minimums and maximums are
flctuating much more quickly. And it varies tremendously. Actually
thre's an interesting literature of whether or not they have siblings,
whther or not they're twins, whether or not they're in a nursery
enironment, whether or not they're alone, hopefully the baby's not
alne, but you know what I mean, that they're sleeping alone in a room
whle you're in the other room. There are a couple of things that seem
tohelp which is getting the overall environment into a 24 hour
scedule. So having the room slightly colder, obviously you want babies
tobe nice and cozy, slightly colder when you would like them to be
aseep, slightly warmer for the times you would like them to be awake.
Baies tend to run pretty hot anyway. And obviously you want to be very
caeful about avoiding all extremes of temperature, cold or hot. So if
thy're going through these 90 minute cycles, you're going to have to
adust to those 90 minute cycles as well.

* (01:21:40) Polyphasic sleep
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: polyphasic-sleep
:ED:
Sothen people say, well, that's not going to help me at all because how
doI deal with the fact that I need to be up every 90 minutes at night?
Thre are a couple tools that can be helpful. The first one is going to
beto try and understand the relationship between calm and deep sleep.
Sothe autonomic nervous system can put us into states of panic, where
tht's kind of seesaw of autonomic alertness, goes all the way to panic.
Orit can be alertness, or it can be alert and calm, right? So there's a
rage there, it's a continuum. It can also be that you're in deep sleep,
sothe other end of the seesaw is way up or you're your in light sleep
oryou're kind of sleepy, or you're just feeling kind of relaxed.
Pehaps the most important thing if you're having to map to a baby
scedule in order to make sure that they're getting changings, and
nusing, etc, at the appropriate times, is to try and maintain, if you
ca't sleep or you can't sleep continuously, to try and maintain your
auonomic nervous system in a place where you're not going into
heghtened states of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping. Now,
I ealize that this could be translated to try and stay calm while
yo're sleep deprived, which is very hard for people to do. But this is
whre the non-sleep deep rest protocols surface again and can
poentially be very beneficial for people to be able to recover, not
neessarily sleep, but for them to maintain a certain amount of
auonomic regulation. So what would this look like? This would look
lie, the baby goes down, maybe it's only going to go down for 45
miutes. If you can capture sleep, capture sleep. There are some data
shwing what's called polyphasic sleep. If you can sleep in 45 minute
inrements or batches, even if it's spread throughout the day with
peiods of wakefulness in between, as miserable as that sound, there are
acually some adults that have deliberately employed that, who don't
hae children for the sake of work productivity. And it does tend to
reuce the total overall amount of sleep that you need. It is a very
had schedule for most people to maintain but if you have a baby, the
bay may be throwing you into that kind of schedule anyway. So if you
ca get 45 minutes sleep while they sleep, great. If you can get another
45minutes after waking and then they go back down to sleep, great. So
asmany phases of sleep as you can get. But if you can't sleep the data
onnon-sleep deep rest type protocols does show that at least from a
nerochemical level, I want to be clear what that means, reset of things
lie dopamine levels in the basal ganglia measured by things like
poitron emission tomography, etc. Those things tend to reset themselves
prtty well if you can access these deep rest state. So that means not
beng alert throughout the entire time that the baby is sleeping. Trying
tosort of mirror the baby's sleep cycle which can be brutal for certain
peple, and especially if you're trying to prepare meals and do all
thse things. So I do recognize that there are a lot of constraints on
paenting not just mapping on your baby's sleep schedule. As children
aproach ages one, two, three, four, that's when certainly the optics of
th eyes have improved but you don't want to damage the eyes of course,
wih very bright light. They are much more sensitive even until they're
kid of 10, 11 years old. And we'll talk about vision in children in a
moent. But trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep through,
hoefully not through the use of administering melatonin to the kids
'cuse that's what I talked about before why that could potentially be
derimental talk about that with your doctor.

* (01:25:25) Ultradian cycles in children
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: ultradian-cycles-in-children
:ED:
Bu more so trying to get longer blocks of sleep that map onto these
ulradian cycles. So it would be better off to get a three hour, like
tw-90 minute cycles, than a four hour batch of sleep because waking up
inthe middle of those ultradian cycles can just be brutal for parent
an kid. So if one can't get a full six or 10, or some kids should even
besleeping 12 hours when they're growing quickly, trying to get batches
ofsleep even if they're fractured throughout the 24 hour cycle that are
mached more to these 90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian
cyle of 90 minutes, or two back to back, or three back to back to back.
Tht's going to be better than waking up in the middle of an ultradian
cyle. It's just going to set any number of other things in a better
diection than were you to try to say, just enforce or force a full
eiht or 10 hours of sleep. That's at least what the literature shows.
Soe kids sleep great through the night, starting at a very young age,
oters don't. I typically hear from people who are struggling
trmendously, they're losing their mind understandably, because they're
no sleeping, their kid's not sleeping and, or their kid is sleeping for
suh brief periods. So in other words, try and access deep calm if you
ca't sleep, try and access sleep, if you can sleep even if it's
frctured. And then you say, well, what about all the sunlight viewing
an the exercise stuff? When sleep is really, really dismantled, meaning
its happening in various times of day or night, that's especially, at
thse times it's going to be especially important for the parent to get
moning and evening sunlight because your circadian clock is going into
a ailspin and it basically wants to anchor to something. So you want to
gie it two anchors, morning and evening light. Okay, so this is rather
diferent than what I described for shift work, this is when things are
relly chaotic and you're just not able to sleep. Similar circumstances
ca arise if you're taking care of a very sick loved one, you're up all
niht. Try and stay calm using NSDR protocols, I know it's harder to do
thn to say, but those protocols are there, they're free, there's
reearch to support them. Try and get sleep whenever you can but also
tr to get morning sunlight and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can
an if you can't get that, use artificial light, okay?

* (01:27:38) Teens and puberty
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: teens-and-puberty
:ED:
Wht about later life? So kids now, adolescents, teens, it is true that
tens have a tendency to wake up later and go to sleep later. In part,
jut because they're sleeping a lot more. They're churning out
goadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone. Their whole
boies are changing. I don't know whether or not people realize this,
bu the fastest rate of aging that any of us will ever undergo is
puerty. That is the fastest rate of aging. And so there's a huge number
ofbiological processes that are happening during puberty, probably
deote a whole episode to puberty as a fascinating aspect to the life
corse but it is accelerated period of aging. And the circadian clock
mehanisms sometimes are very intact, and sometimes they're a little
dimantled and going through some change, but prioritize the duration of
slep for adolescents and teens. Now, if that means they're sleeping
unil 2:00 PM, and then waking up and then they're up all night, the up
al night part can become a problem especially with all the devices,
teting in their rooms or playing video games. Morning and evening
sulight would be ideal but some kids are just going to sleep through
th morning sunlight. However, if you were to measure their temperature,
wht you would find is that their temperature minimum would come later
inthe morning. It's not going to be 8:00 AM. It's going to be maybe
evn 10:00 AM, if they're sleeping until 11 or 12. Or it might be 8:00
AMif they're sleeping until 10. Remember temperature minimum is two
hors before your average waking time, typically. So in teens, it
maimizes the total amount of sleep. Try and get regular sunlight either
inthe morning or in the evening or both. But if they're sleeping
though the morning sunrise, that's probably not as much of an issue,
waing them up and depriving them of sleep is probably worse because
thir T-min, their temperature minimum, is actually falling later. So
thir circadian dead zone is later, etc. So I think with adolescents and
tens it makes sense to kind of give them a little bit more rope in
tems of allowing them some leeway to adjust their own schedule. Some
scools are even starting classes later on the basis of some very good
bilogy to support this late shifted rhythm and this extended sleep
phse.

Thre are data from Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, Department of Psychiatry and
Beavioral Sciences, and others at Stanford, showing that turning on the
lihts in the room of a teen before they wake up helps them get more
slep the subsequent night, it also tricks them into going to sleep a
litle bit earlier. But it gives them about 45 minutes more of deep
slep. And that's been shown statistically, total sleep time increases
aswell. If they're hiding under the covers, that's not going to work,
bu their eyes don't have to be open. I know a few parents now that are
coing in with a flashlight and flashing their kids over their eyelids
beore they wake up in hopes of getting this to work, some have told me
ths is working. That's not part of a standard study. But it does seem
towork because, now you should know why, because if light's getting
though the eyelids, and it's say 8:00 AM and the kid is still asleep
an they're going to wake up at 10, you're giving them light just after
oraround their temperature minimum, which is going to make them want to
goto sleep earlier. And in the case of teens, for some reason we don't
qute understand, sleep longer, about 45 minutes longer, spend more time
indeep sleep. Adults can do this too, if you can persuade someone or
pu your lights on timer for lights to go on before you wake up, that's
relly going to help you wake up earlier, okay. So if you're starting to
her some themes are really resounding over and over again, that should
bereassuring to you, right. That these are core mechanisms.
Fotunately, there aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.

* (01:31:20) Older people and cicadian rhythms
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: older-people-and-cicadian-rhythms
:ED:
No in the elderly, there's a real tendency to want to go to sleep very
ealy and wake up very early. And people should talk to their physician.
Thre is some evidence that melatonin levels and patterns of melatonin
seretion can become a little chaotic in elderly folks. What do I mean
byelderly? Well, it's going to differ. Rates of aging differ, right?
Yo see some 65 year olds that are struggling to move and seem much
oler than some 65 year olds that are, you know, still hustling around
an have tons of energy. There's a lot of variation, some of it's
geetic, some of it's lifestyle factors, you know, it really varies.
Cetainly lifestyle factors can play an important role in rates of
agng. I think that the most prominent results from sleep and circadian
rhthms in the elderly are they need to get as much natural light, even
ifit's through windows. I realize that some elderly folks can't get
ouside as easily. It's not safe for them to do it, they can't move
arund as easily. Exercise can come in various forms for people that
ca't get outside and get a ton of sunlight by jogging or cycling. If
thy're not able to do that, light through window in that case, open
widow ideally, but for temperature reasons, etc, sometimes the window
ha to be closed. Getting people near that window and away from
arificial light early in the day, and away from artificial lights
duing the night phase can have a tremendous effect. And in the elderly
tht's when melatonin might be a viable option. And this should be
dicussed with a physician, of course, but you know, you're way past the
puerty time point. In most cases, people who are in their 70s, and 80s,
an 90s, are not churning out a lot of GnRH and luteinizing hormone to
bein with. And that's where struggles with falling asleep and staying
aseep, all the same parameters and things we've described before still
aply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, but that's where melatonin
miht be of greatest benefit. And again, I'm not pushing melatonin here
bu I think for elderly folks who are having trouble falling and staying
aseep, that might be worthwhile. There are, and I should just also
metion that regular schedule for folks that are elderly and as much
naural light as safely possible, those are going to be the key levers
fo adjusting sleep in circadian schedules.

* (01:33:48) Sleepy Supplements
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: sleepy-supplements
:ED:
I'e mentioned before in previous podcasts, other supplements besides
meatonin. And some of those supplements are quite good for sleep. You
knw, I'm not a supplement pusher, I am somebody who takes supplements,
I elieve in them, some have worked for me some have not worked as well,
bu I certainly believe in getting the behaviors right. Whether or not
its NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths, or cold
shwers, or what have you, behavioral protocols first. There are some
suplements that I've mentioned in previous podcasts but I've seemed to
ge a lot of questions about. So I just want to take a couple minutes
an just talk about some of the supplements that can be beneficial for
heping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, and even being
abe to compact your sleep schedule into a shorter period of hours,
mening getting by well with less sleep. People take a lot of sleeping
pils. I'm not going to tell people not to take sleeping pills. They can
bevery problematic, habit-forming, high side-effect incidents in many
caes, some people can handle them just fine. Again, I'm no physician,
I' not prescribing anything. I'm a professor, so I profess a lot of
thngs some of which are my opinion. Although, if you look at the
scentific literature, there are some impressive data around some
no-prescription drug type supplements that have fairly high safety
magins that you might consider but you should talk to your doctor
alays before adding or taking anything out of your health regimes,
riht? Your health is not my responsibility, it's your responsibility,
sobe a stringent filter. Along those lines, one of the most powerful
an useful tools that I've mentioned here on many times and I plan to
metion many many more times, is the website examine.com which I have no
afiliation with but is a wonderful site that links you to quality peer
reiewed studies relating to just about any supplement including some
saety warnings. Will also tell you what subjects, whether or not it was
ras, cats, elderly folks or kids, that a given study was done on, which
isimportant, can be kind of hard to pull from sites where people are
jut advertising supplements, right? They usually don't tell you what
th study was and who were these rats, who were these kids, etc. There
ar three supplements that at least for me have had a tremendously
poitive effect on my sleep that some of you might consider. I would
sa, if you're doing everything properly behaviorally and you're still
haing issues, then supplements might be a good thing for you. Or if you
ar traveling and you want a little bit of extra help in buffering your
slep wakefulness protocols. Some people like to go just to the
suplements. They're like, what should I take? I have people in my life
tht are like, just tell me what to take, you know. I'm more of, here's
wht you might want to do or not do and then think about what you might
wat to take or not take. But personal preference and it's a free
contry, so you can do what you like. Magnesium. So magnesium has been
shwn to increase the depth of sleep and has been shown to decrease the
amunt of time that it takes to access sleep, to fall asleep. It comes
invarious forms. I've talked a bunch of times about magnesium
theonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate. which seems to be the more
biavailable form of magnesium. And magnesium threonate it seems is
shdowed preferentially to the brain which is where you want it. And
thre's certain transporters, it actually engages the GABA pathway which
teds to turn off certain areas of the forebrain and allows you to kind
offall asleep. There is a study, if you'd like to explore it since
peple serious about supplementation might want to explore the study,
whch is Ates et al, A-T-E-S Dose-Dependent Absorption Profile of
Diferent Magnesium Compounds. Looks to me like a quality peer reviewed
paer. I can put the link in the caption, and it explores all the
diferent forms of magnesium. It does seem like magnesium glycinate can
besimilar to magnesium threonate in terms of which tissues it is shadow
to Magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E, is preferentially shadow to the
mucle, it appears, as opposed to the brain. So it's going to be more of
a uscle repair type thing or restoring magnesium stores in the
peiphery as opposed to the brain. Magnesium citrate has another name
tht I won't mention ingest, because magnesium citrate's main effect, at
lest on me and the people I know, seems to be a laxative effect as
oposed to a cognitive effect. There's also some evidence that magnesium
theonate can be neuroprotective. Those data come from quality labs,
motly rodent studies, not human studies, but it's kind of interesting.
An again, the safety margins for these things tend to be pretty high,
bu anytime you're going to take something new you should approach it
wih caution, especially since magnesium could be involved in heart
rhthm and things of that sort. The other supplement that has been very
beeficial for me is theanine. So this is T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,
T--E-A-N-I-N-E. Theanine activates certain GABA pathways which are
inolved in turning off top-down processing and thinking, making it
eaier to fall asleep. And theanine, 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams
ha a calming effect. Theanine is now showing up in a number of
diferent energy drinks and even some coffees as a way to try and get
peple to ingest more of a given type of coffee 'cause the idea is it
wil take away the jitters and the anxiety, allowing people to drink
moe coffee. I'm talking about taking magnesium and theanine 30 to 60
miutes before bedtime not during the day to quell anxiety, but rather
30to 60 minutes before bedtime with or without food, for me hasn't made
a ifference. And the combination of those two things has really helped.
Thanine for sleepwalkers can be a problem. It does increase the
inensity of your dreams, it gives you very vivid dreams. So for sleep
wakers or people that get night terrors stay away from theanine is my
adice. Magnesium theanine might be something to explore for those of
yo that don't have those issues. With the emphasis on might. And then
I'e talked about a compound, and last time I talked about the
mehanisms of apigenin which is a derivative of chamomile, A-P-I-G-E-N,
whch acts as a little bit of a hypnotic by activating chloride
chnnels, hyperpolarized neurons, increases GABA in the brain, basically
maes you feel a little sleepy. And chamomile, for those of you that
red your what was it that Peter Rabbits snuck into Mr. McGregor's
gaden, ate the chamomile, fell asleep, Mr. Gregory came back. Okay,
anone flashing back to elementary school? Okay. There's a story about
chmomile having these kind of sedative-like effects, apigenin is highly
cocentrated chamomile also has intra-estrogenic effects. So if you want
tokeep your estrogen up you might want to be cautious about apigenin.
Tht's where things like examine.com become really useful because you
ca go to examine you put in apigenin, and it'll tell you all the things
tht it does and all the things that it does can sometimes include
thngs that you had no idea, like reducing conversion of certain
anrogens to estrogens which you might like or you might want to avoid.
Tht's up to you and where you want your estrogen levels depending on
wh you are and what your life circumstances and goals are. A few other
thngs that can help the transition to sleep, are things like 5-HTP
L-ryptophan. I've talked about why I'm not a fan of those for me, they
ted to throw me into deep sleep and then I wake up and I can't fall
bak asleep. So I don't like to tinker with my [[id:2b6e8820-a254-4138-ad80-dc71c97a8082][Serotonin]] system, I don't
lie to tinker with my dopamine system, for entirely other reasons but
noe of which are particularly concerning it's just that I find that if
I ncrease my dopamine by taking L-Tyrosine in pill form, then I crash
relly hard the next day. Or if I take 5-HTP L-tryptophan I fall deeply
aseep and then I wake up. But I didn't mention that there might be ways
tomake sleep more compact. And so this is actually a request to you.

* (01:42:00) Red Pills & Acupuncture
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: red-pills-acupuncture
:ED:
I ad a really interesting experience when I was a postdoc. I went for
th first time to an acupuncturist. I know there're varying thoughts and
opnions out there about acupuncture. I can't say that I've benefit so
muh from the acupuncture. There are now quality peer reviewed studies
shwing publishing neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
shwing that acupuncture can stimulate some anti-inflammatory compounds
deending on where the acupuncture is done. These are really good
stdies, came out last year. I talked about this on Instagram, I may
tak about it again. As well as certain acupuncture sites that increase
inlammation. So, you know, you can get different types of effects, you
ca't just say acupuncture is great across the board. And I'm assuming
tht the acupuncturist know which sites are good for increasing
inlammation, which ones are good for decreasing inflammation. However,
ths acupuncturist that I went to gave me these red pills. He said,
thse are minerals for sleep, and it was remarkable. I took the red
pils. Isn't that a thing now? Take the red pill. I don't know what that
mens, right, 'cause I'm not tuned in. But these red pills looked like
litle M&Ms, I took a couple of them on his suggestion and I fell deeply
aseep and four hours later woke up feeling incredibly rested, more
reted than I had ever felt in my entire life and I never required more
thn four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist moved away, I never
fiured out what was in those red pills. I didn't get a chance to do the
mas spectroscopy, and I still wonder, he said they were minerals. So
soebody out there knows what these red pills are and what this compound
is And it was incredible, and I would love to know what those are. So
ifyou know, please don't go taking red pills at random to try and
rereate this non-experiment experience of mine. But please do contact
meif you find out or if you're an acupuncturist and you know what these
myterious red pills were, because they were pretty awesome.

* (01:43:50) Highlights
:POPERTIES:
:CSTOM_ID: highlights
:ED:
One again, I've thrown a tremendous amount of information at you. I
hoe you will figure out your temperature minimum and start working with
tht to access the sleep and wakeful cycles that you want to access. I
hoe that you will explore NSDR. You might want to explore
suplementation if that's your thing. You have now access to a lot of
mehanism about sleep and wakefulness. But in keeping with the theme of
ths podcast, where we stay on topic for an entire month or even
slghtly more, we are not done with sleep and wakefulness. I know this
isvery different than the typical podcast format, where one week it's
ho to become superhuman and the next week it's how to, you know,
deelop growth mindset and it's kind of all over the place with episode
toepisode. We are staying on track because I really believe that as we
drll deeper and deeper into these mechanisms, and you start hearing
soe of the same themes again and again, you're going to start to
deelop an intuition and an understanding of how these systems work in
yo and your particular life circumstances. And my goal is really to
evntually become obsolete. It's what my graduate advisor used to call
th hit by a bus principle. She had a somewhat morbid sense of humor and
usd to be, well, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, what are you going to
dowithout me blabbing at you here? So I don't want to get hit by a bus,
I lan on living a very long time, if I have anything to say about it.
Bu were I to get hit by a bus tomorrow, what would you do for your
slep and wakefulness, right? You could put a comment on YouTube, which
I ope you will do. But if I were hit by a bus and killed then I
woldn't be able to answer your question. So know your temperature
miimum, understand light in the early part of the day is valuable.
Liht when you want to be awake, provided it's not so bright it's
daaging. It's great for you whether or not it comes from screens or
sulight but sunlight's better. Avoid light in the four to six hours
beore your temperature minimum or else you're going to delay your clock
uness you're traveling and that's what you want to do. Okay? Use
teperature, increase temperature to shift your clock, decrease
teperature to delay your clock, okay? Map out your temperature and
unerstand it. You don't have to know degree by degree across the day,
knw your minimum, know your maximum temperature in your 24 hour cycle
an you'll feel great power through that because then you'll know also
abut these ultradian cycles, these 90 minute cycles within which you
ca do focused work. Don't expect the focus to come early, expect focus
tocome in the middle and then kind of taper off. I talked a little bit
abut kids, a little bit about elderly, about parenting, we are going to
cotinue, there's going to be more. But now shift workers, travelers,
peple that are jet lagging themselves at home, you now have levers in
plce. Information can be powerful but you have to implement it in ways,
obiously safe ways and reasonable ways. But implementing this knowledge
inthe ways that you trust are safe and reasonable for you is going to
bethe way that you can develop a bit of a laboratory about yourself. I
loth the term biohacking, sorry, biohackers. I don't believe in hacking
anthing. I believe in understanding mechanism and applying the
prnciples of mechanism for which there are large bodies of quality peer
reiewed data, and even a whole center of mass around certain biological
prnciples, like the effects of light and temperature, temperature
miimums, that will allow you to shift your biology in the ways that you
wat it to go. That will allow you to shift your psychology in the ways
yo want to go. Next podcast episode, we are going to talk more about a
fe things. First of all, we're going to answer more of your questions
'cuse during office hours, I didn't get to all your questions from the
prvious episode. So I do read the comments and we're paying attention
an figuring out the most common questions. We are going to get to some
ofthe harder topics. Someone came at me, it's always fun when somebody
dos this, they said, well, these are just the kind of basal low-level
qustions. What about the big stuff? What about dreaming and lucid
draming and consciousness? Look, I'll talk about that stuff. And I'm
plnning to do that, some of which in the next episode and the following
epsode maybe even. But I want to give you data. I want to give you
thngs that are supported by data. So I will try to speculate as little
aspossible because this is a podcast about science and science-based
tols for everyday life. This is not about me speculating. Many people
hae speculated about the role of sleep, dreaming and consciousness.
Facinating topics, and a rather circular argument frankly, it's been
gong on for centuries. Someday we'll get there, right now we're
cocentrating on these deep biological mechanisms that make you who you
ar and allow you to feel certain ways, good or bad, allow you to
fuction physically in certain ways, good or bad, and give you more of a
sese of control. That's my goal here.

* (01:48:30) Feedback and Support
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: feedback-and-support
:END:
Many people have quite graciously asked how they can help support the
podcast. First of all, thank you, we appreciate the question. You can
support the podcast by subscribing to the podcast on YouTube, as well as
subscribing on Apple or Spotify. And you can also leave us comments and
feedback on YouTube and at Apple that really helps. We would hope the
feedback would be positive, but nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask
questions, we will use those questions to create future content for the
podcast. As well, if you can recommend the podcast to friends and family
and other people that you think might find the information of use,
that's terrific. And check out our sponsors that we mentioned at the
beginning. That's a really great way to help support us and our ability
to bring you this information. Along those lines, a lot of people have
asked me about supplements and supplement companies. So up until now
I've been reluctant to recommend specific supplement brands. The
supplement industry is kind of a wild west of different brands,
different levels of quality and stringency. It can be very complicated
and what's on the bottle is not always what you're getting. The quality
of what you're getting varies from company to company, and even from
substance to substance, batch to batch. So I'm pleased to say that I'm
partnering with Thorne, Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E, is a supplement
company that works with the Mayo Clinic, and with pretty much all the
major sports team organizations and that I know to have the highest
levels of stringency in terms of what's in the bottle matches what's
listed on the bottle, and in terms of the quality of what they put in
those supplements. So, while I mentioned earlier, that supplements
aren't for everybody. If you're interested in trying some of these
supplements you might want to check out Thorne. If you want to do that
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman. So it's t-h-o-r-n-e.com, c-o-m
slash the letter u slash huberman, and if you do that, they'll give you
20% off any of the supplements that you happen to purchase from Thorne.
Thanks so much for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. See
you next time on the Huberman Lab Podcast. And as always, thanks for
your interest in science. [bright music]
