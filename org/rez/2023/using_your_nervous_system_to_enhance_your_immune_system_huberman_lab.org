* Summary by podcastnotes.org
** *Key Takeaways*

- The immune system has three main systems of protection: physical barriers
  (e.g., skin, eyes), innate immune system (e.g., white blood cells, killer
  cells), adaptive immune system (e.g., creation of antibodies)
- Sickness-related behaviors look a lot like depressive symptoms leading to a
  theory that depression involves activation of inflammatory cytokines
- Stimulation of the dopamine pathway can accelerate healing and liberate
  systems in the body which allow inflammatory pathways to go down and
  anti-inflammatory pathways to go up
- [[id:2965cd54-8ffb-48a1-9b88-07ca58f97469][The Wim Hof Method]] breathing is a zero-cost tool shown to enhance the immune
  system by releasing adrenaline and reducing the effects of illness symptoms
- Wim Hof breathing steps:(1) 20-30 deep inhales and exhales through nose; (2)
  exhale of all air to empty lungs; (3) hold breath for up to 60 seconds; (4)
  repeat 2-4 rounds
- Maintaining a healthy microbiome (gut, eyes, mucus) supports good health:
  nasal breathe as often as possible, don't touch eyes after touching other
  things, ingest fermented foods to enhance gut microbiota

** *Immune System 101*

- *Three main layers of protection:* (1) physical barrier AKA skin; (2) innate
  immune system; (3) adaptive immune system
- The primary sites of infections from the outside world are through eyes, ears,
  nostrils, mouth
- *Mucus* acts as a filter for bacteria and viruses, making sure certain things
  don't make it in and you can extract nutrients from others
- *Innate immune system:* rapid response system when the body doesn't recognize
  foreign invader (bacteria, virus, or parasite) trying to enter the body
- *White blood cells* (part of the innate immune system) will go to the site of
  the foreign invader and try to kill by engulfing and isolating
- [[id:f730d8cf-edf2-4818-9bcc-c9748e2a798e][Cytokines]] (also part of the innate immune system) send “help me” signals to
  bring in killer cells and white blood cells to get rid of the foreign invader
- The *adaptive immune system* creates antibodies against bacteria, viruses,
  parasites, physical intruders to the system
- *The adaptive immune system creates a memory of prior infection so it can
  create antibodies anytime that same invader comes back*
- Hematopoietic stem cells can create and maintain antibodies so recognized
  virus doesn't go through
- *Immunoglobulin M (IgM):* first of adaptive immune responses that comes on
  board; this is the first marker you'll see for new or recent infection
- *Immunoglobulin G (IgG)* comes on board later

** *Maintaining A Healthy Microbiome*

- *Maintaining a microbiome is critical for good health* -- microbiota isn't just
  referring to the gut; there's microbiota along with every orifice of the body
  from eyes, nostrils, etc.
- *Tip 1: Use nasal breathing (not mouth breathing) as often as possible because
  the nasal microbiome* *is particularly good at scrubbing infection*
- *Tip 2: Don't touch your eyes after touching anything else since the eyes are a
  primary entry point for a lot of bacteria and viruses*
- *Tip 3: Enhance gut microbiota by ingesting 2-4 servings per day of low sugar
  fermented foods*

** *Sickness Behavior*

- *Natural behaviors when fighting illness or virus:* slow down, reduce grooming
  activities and cosmetic behaviors, lose appetite, sleep more, vulnerability
  and desire to have others take care of us -- or -- desire to be alone more
  than usual, loss of libido, aversion to bright light
- More sleep gives the lymphatic system a chance to ramp up activity
- *Sickness behaviors look a lot like depressive symptoms leading to a theory
  that depression involves activation of inflammatory cytokines*
- Reduced appetite (particularly for protein-rich foods) may be an attempt by
  the body to reduce iron intake because bacteria thrive when iron is high
- The [[id:4bc93a99-ea0f-4566-9d08-0bb12f288ebe][vagus nerve]] connects the body and brain and signals sickness behavior
- Fever is a functional and adaptive response to kill of invaders
- *There's a difference between regular sleep and sleep that's in support of the
  immune system:* sleep associated with infection releases more serotonin to
  support a robust immune response

** *Leverage Nervous System To Boost Immune System*

- The nervous system can be activated and used to control the immune system
- *Basics we know give ourselves the best chance at health:* hydrate with water
  and electrolytes, good quality sleep, sunshine, good nutrition, at least 150
  minutes of exercise each week, hydration, strong social relationships, etc.
- *The glymphatic system which clears out debris that surrounds injured neurons
  is underactive in illness*
- *Two methods of glymphatic system activation:* (1) sleeping on the side instead
  of back or stomach; (2) sleeping with feet slightly elevated
- *Sauna or hot bath for about 15 minutes* will help the body reduce internal
  temperature afterward /(caution -- do not get into a sauna if you have a fever)/
- *Heat cycle protocol:* stay in heat environment for 15 minutes, cool off for 5
  minutes, reenter heat
- *Wim Hof breathing protocol was shown to enhance immune system & combat illness*
- *Wim Hof breathing steps:* (1) 20-30 deep inhales through the nose and exhales
  through the mouth; (2) exhale of all air to empty lungs; (3) hold breath for
  up to 60 seconds; (4) repeat 2-4 rounds
- *Why does breathing work?* Breathing protocol activates the sympathetic nervous
  system which allows activation of the normal pathway (trigger release of
  adrenaline and epinephrine) which enhances immune function

** *Impact Of Mindset On Immune System*

- The way we think about something can change the core of our physiology
- *Keep stress in check: you can worry yourself sick!*
- Stimulation of the dopamine pathway -- even by thinking positively about the future -- activates the mesolimbic pathway and can increase the rate of healing
- *Stimulation of the dopamine pathway can accelerate healing and liberate systems in the body which allow inflammatory pathways to go down and anti-inflammatory pathways to go up*

** *New Ways To Address Symptoms When You're Already Sick*
- *Spirulina* can have powerful effects in relieving nasal stuffiness and inflammation
- *Acupuncture* can stimulate vagal-adrenal reflex and reduce inflammation
