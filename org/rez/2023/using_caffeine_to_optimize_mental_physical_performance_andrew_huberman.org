* Summary by podcastnotes.org
Added some notes here andd there..

**  Key Takeaways
- Caffeine is not just a stimulant, it’s a strong reinforcer that subconsciously
  drives behavior - caffeine (tasteless) added to anything will give you a
  preference for that thing, this applies to behavior, food, company
- Caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine in the forebrain which improves
  the ability to think, adjust to mental and physical demands
- Caffeine increases the number of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway of
  the brain
- Caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine which offsets sleepiness in the
  first half of the day
- Delay caffeine intake 90-120 minutes after waking (unless doing intense
  exercise) to fight off afternoon sleepiness

 - Tip #1: If this sounds impossible at first, delay in 15-minute increments
   until you hit 90 minutes+
 - Tip #2: If you can’t wait, drink half of the caffeine when you wake up and
   the other half a couple of hours later

- Does caffeine make you jittery? Consume at least an equal volume of water
  (with a pinch of salt) or electrolyte drink with caffeine to offset
- To extract more benefits from caffeine (assuming you already delay intake):
  (1) Consume on an empty stomach if you can tolerate it; (2) Abstain from
  caffeine for 2-5 days then resume; (3) Half your amount of caffeine intake for
  a period of time then resume

**  Introduction

Dr. Andrew Huberman, Ph.D. is a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
Stanford University School of Medicine. His lab focuses on neural regeneration,
neuroplasticity, and brain states such as stress, focus, fear, and optimal
performance.

In this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman explains how to
optimize caffeine intake for maximal mental and physical health and performance.
He explains optimal dosage, timing, mechanism, effects on health and longevity,
and more!

Host: Andrew Huberman (@hubermanlab)

**  GLP-1: Hot Off The Press

- Yerba mate tea (avoid smoked variety) stimulates the release of GLP-1 which
  reduces hunger, increases satiety in the gut and brain
- GLP-1 stimulates thermogenesis (use of more metabolic energy) and converts
  white fat cells (stored energy) into beige or brown fat cells (increases basal
  metabolic rate)
- GLP-1 can be stimulated with exercise such as fast cardio
- Prescription GLP-1 analogs are available through physician

**  Caffeine Is A Strong Reinforcer

- The effects of caffeine are largely subconscious
- The nervous system recalls previous experiences of good or not-good feelings
  and adjusts behavior accordingly - you are drawn to a certain mug, certain
  location, and certain caffeine ritual
- Caffeine makes us feel better in the immediate minutes before and after
  ingestion
- Caffeine stimulates dopamine, acetylcholine, and adenosine
  - Caffeine stimulates dopamine release in the region of the brain associated
    with clarity of thought
  - Caffeine also increases dopamine receptors in the reward pathway
  - Caffeine is a strong adenosine antagonist, reducing feelings of lethargy and
    sleepiness

**  Adenosine

- Caffeine is a plant alkaloid (bitter)
- Adenosine makes us feel tired - caffeine blocks adenosine and biases our
  system toward a more energetic pathway
- Adenosine levels are as low as they will be in the morning - avoid caffeine
  first 90-120 minutes after waking
- Caffeine does not increase energy - it’s borrowing energy, altering the time
  at which adenosine is released
- Adenosine is an inherent part of biology, it’s not going anywhere and will
  release every 24 hours
- How to clear adenosine: (1) sleep; (2) non-sleep deep rest; (3) view morning
  sunlight (spikes cortisol which clears residual adenosine); (4) some exercise
  can reduce adenosine

**  Optimizing Caffeine Intake

- Bodyweight is a good measure of proper caffeine dose for your body: 1-3mg/kg
  body weight per setting
  - This dose will likely provide you with all the benefits without the jitters

- Caffeine tolerance depends on one’s preexisting disposition (are you anxious,
  calm, stressed, etc.), caffeine tolerance
- Some people will feel anxious with caffeine use, some will feel nothing -
  start low and increase if you’re just starting
- Timing of intake: delay caffeine intake 90-120 minutes after waking most
  days - this will help you avoid afternoon crash and the need for that second
  cup of coffee in the afternoon which can disrupt the depth and quality of
  sleep
  - Adenosine builds up the longer we are awake, it’s lowest in the morning
  - Sets into motion cascade which will set you up for better sleep that night
    and more alertness the next day

- If you wake up and do intense exercise within the first 90 minutes of waking,
  drink the caffeine before but the combination of caffeine and exercise may
  increase afternoon fatigue
- you want to increase cortisol levels (by doing exercises)
  - this will "clean up" remaining adenosine in the body
- If you really can’t delay caffeine, you can extend the arc of caffeine if you
  drink half when you wake up and half later
- Caffeine has a more potent stimulant effect on an empty stomach (this may
  induce jitteriness which can be offset with 200-400mg of thionine)
  - Thionine has positive effects on sleep depth and duration, has antidepressant
    and antianxiety effects, and has endothelial benefits
  - You don’t have to take thionine every time you drink coffee throughout the
    day, just the first
- Tip: if you regularly ingest caffeine, performance-enhancing effects will
  increase if you abstain for a few days and then start again

**  Caffeine Myths & When To Avoid

- Caffeine does not create or exacerbate osteoporosis
- Caffeine does not appear to have a direct or indirect impact on estrogen or
  testosterone (i.e., caffeine does not appear to increase or decrease estrogen
  or testosterone)
  - But excessive caffeine intake does increase sex hormone binding globulin,
    though not to concerning levels

- *Avoid caffeine intake 12 hours prior to sleep* - the quarter-life of caffeine
  is 12 hours
- If you are not used to caffeine, avoid intake on days of tough physical or
  mental demands as the negative side effects may outweigh the benefits if you
  are not accustomed
- Don’t try the “napaccino” - ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon then
  taking a short nap, with the assumption that the caffeine will kick in when
  you wake up and you’ll feel stimulated

**  Benefits Of Caffeine Intake

- Caffeine has neuroprotective effects, provided intake is not excessive
- The properties of caffeine may be protective against depression but unknown
  whether the correlation is direct or indirect
- Caffeine consumption while fasting increases focus and alertness within 5
  minutes that peaks at 30 minutes and lasts up to 60 minutes
- Shortens reaction time if consumed about 30 minutes prior to the task
- Lowers activation threshold of learning and memory (you can recall things
  easier)
- Caffeine can increase physical performance enhancement, improve peak
  performance, increase aerobic endurance
- Brief or extended breaks from caffeine can enhance the effects once you resume
- Caffeine increases aerobic power throughout the entire menstrual cycle

**  Caffeine For Enhancing Mental Performance

- Spiking adrenaline after learning can enhance memory and recall
- Tip: abstain from caffeine when trying to learn something, then drink caffeine
  immediately after for improved memory
- Ingesting caffeine prior to exercise further increases dopamine release - this
  has a few benefits, most importantly creating a positive feeling about the
  exercise and maybe changing your association with exercise if you don’t
  otherwise like it

 - This does not hold if you drink caffeine every time you exercise

- Ingesting caffeine every other day can help you maximize the positive effects
  of caffeine without extended abstinence
- Pro-health effects of caffeine (assuming you are getting good sleep): (1)
  neuroprotective effects - may offset some neurodegenerative diseases; (2) can
  diminish headache, particularly in combination with aspirin; (3) may provide
  brief but substantial relief from asthma; (4) improves focus and alertness in
  people with ADHD

*** Caffeine Benefits for Mental & Physical Performance

Caffeine is a staple in the daily routine of most adults, consumed at regular
intervals throughout the day.

In fact, many people feel the effects of caffeine withdrawal if their intake is
delayed even by a few minutes.

This has led some to believe that caffeine is addictive or harmful. However,
research suggests that caffeine has numerous benefits for both mental and
physical performance.

One of the main benefits of caffeine is its neuroprotective effects. Caffeine
increases the levels of neuromodulators such as dopamine and norepinephrine,
which are responsible for increasing alertness, motivation, and drive.

Studies show that regular caffeine intake is inversely related to levels of
depression, suggesting that it may have antidepressant effects, either directly
or indirectly.

Caffeine also improves mental and physical performance.

Thousands of studies have shown that caffeine reduces reaction time, making us
quicker to respond to stimuli. In laboratory studies, participants who ingested
caffeine 30 minutes before a task showed significant improvements in reaction
time. Additionally, caffeine can improve physical performance by increasing
endurance and reducing muscle pain.

It's important to note that the effects of caffeine on mental and physical
performance can be further enhanced by consuming it at regular intervals while
working.

Ingesting caffeine in pill form or drinking it quickly will result in an
increase in alertness within 5 minutes, peaking at 30 minutes and lasting for up
to 60 minutes.

*** Caffeine Effects on Brain; Reward Pathways

Caffeine is a naturally occurring substance that can be found in certain plants
and flowers.

It is known for its ability to improve alertness, memory, and reaction time in
humans. However, recent research has shown that caffeine also acts as a powerful
reinforcer of experience.

This means that not only does caffeine make the drink or food that contains it
more appealing, but it also enhances the experience of the person or object
associated with it.

In a recent study titled "Caffeine in Floral Nectar Enhances a Pollinator's
Memory of Reward," scientists have discovered that caffeine in nature acts as a
reinforcer for bees that are consuming nectar from different flowers.

The researchers found that bees are more likely to remember the location of a
flower that contains caffeine in its nectar, which in turn, helps them to
efficiently gather nectar and pollen for their hive.

It is important to note that caffeine is a bitter substance, and in high
concentrations, it would be unappealing to most insects and animals.

However, in nature, caffeine is present in low concentrations or is masked by
other flavors in flowers and plants, making it more palatable.

*** Caffeine, Adenosine & Reduced Sleepiness 

Caffeine is a methylxanthine, which is a plant alkaloid that is bitter in taste.

It is found in many plants and is consumed by bees and humans in small amounts,
despite its bitter taste.

Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors, which are found in different parts of the
brain and body.

Adenosine makes us feel tired because it taps into the ATP pathway, which is
responsible for energy production in the brain and body.

When caffeine binds to adenosine receptors, it prevents adenosine from breaking
down certain components of the energy production pathway.

This results in increased cyclic AMP, which leads to increased energy levels.
However, it is important to understand that caffeine does not actually create
more energy in the body. Instead, it changes the timing of when sleepy and
energetic signals are received.

It is also important to note that when we wake up after a good night's sleep,
our adenosine levels are at their lowest.

To get the most benefit from caffeine, it is best to avoid consuming it for the
first 90 to 120 minutes after waking, as this allows for the complete clearing
of adenosine from the body.

However, for most people, adenosine levels will accumulate throughout the day,
making them feel more sleepy.

The only way to offset this is by blocking the function of adenosine through the
consumption of caffeine.

*** Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects


Dr. Huberman understands that some people cannot or will not delay their
caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking.

For those who like to wake up and do intense exercise within the first 90
minutes after waking, it is appropriate to ingest caffeine just before the
exercise.

However, it is important to note that this combination of drinking caffeine
shortly after waking and exercising intensely will increase the intensity of the
afternoon fatigue.

For some people, this is not a problem as they can afford to take a nap or do
non-sleep deep rest, step away from work, etc.

In that case, Dr. Huberman strongly encourages regular exercise as it is
beneficial for overall health.

He follows a workout program that involves some early morning workouts shortly
after waking and in those cases, he ingests caffeine just before the workout.

On other days, Dr. Huberman delays his caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes and
has found it to be beneficial. Most people who try this have also reported the
same.

For those who find it difficult to delay their caffeine intake, Dr. Huberman
suggests pushing out the caffeine intake by 15 minutes each day until they reach
the 90 to 120 minutes mark. This might take a week or so, but once they get
there, it will be easy to maintain.

For those who insist on drinking caffeine shortly after waking, Dr. Huberman
suggests drinking half of the caffeine upon waking and the other half an hour
later. This will help offset some of the afternoon crash.

Caffeine has a quarter-life of about 12 hours, which means that if you were to
ingest a cup of coffee at 8 a.m., about 25% of that caffeine action will still
be present at 8 p.m. that night.

This is why it can impede sleep if we take caffeine in the afternoon. By
drinking half of the caffeine upon waking and the other half an hour later, it
will extend the effects of caffeine, preventing the need for more caffeine in
the afternoon and avoiding the afternoon crash.

*** Theanine: Effects & Dosage


Dr. Huberman has previously discussed the effects of theanine on sleep in his
"Toolkit for Sleep" which can be downloaded for free from his website,
hubermanlab.com.

The "sleep stack" he recommends includes magnesium threonate, apogenin, and
theanine and should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep.

However, Dr. Huberman advises against taking theanine before sleep if you tend
to have vivid dreams, night terrors or sleepwalking.

Theanine has a calming effect and can be used to offset jitteriness from
caffeine-containing products during the day.

It stimulates the glutamate and glutamine pathway and competes for the receptors
of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, reducing overall levels of
alertness.

The effective dosage for offsetting jitteriness from caffeine is 200 to 400
milligrams and studies have shown that up to 900 milligrams per day can be safe,
although this may cause sleepiness.

Theanine has other positive effects as well.

A 17-day study showed that consuming 200 to 400 milligrams of theanine one to
three times per day can reduce depression and anxiety.

There is also evidence that theanine can have positive effects on endothelial
cells and increase the function of blood vessels, allowing them to pass more
blood through them and increase elasticity.

*** Other Effects: Osteoporosis, Hormone Levels, Depression


When it comes to caffeine, there are several myths circulating about its effects
on our bodies.

One of the most common is the idea that caffeine can increase the risk of
osteoporosis.

While it is true that caffeine can extract calcium from certain tissues,
large-scale studies have shown that if individuals are getting enough calcium
through their diet, there is no direct relationship between caffeine intake and
osteoporosis.

Another myth surrounding caffeine is that it can reduce hormone levels, such as
testosterone or estrogen.

However, large-scale studies have found that at moderate levels of caffeine
intake, there are no consistent increases or reductions in hormone levels in men
or women that can be directly attributed to caffeine consumption.

It's important to note that these studies are difficult to conduct because of
the high percentage of adults who consume caffeine, making it difficult to find
a control group.

Additionally, caffeine intake has been found to have a slight impact on sex
hormone-binding globulin, a protein present in both men and women that binds to
sex steroid hormones, preventing them from being in their free or active form.

Studies have shown that caffeine intake can increase sex hormone-binding
globulin, which can slightly reduce overall levels of free testosterone and free
estradiol in women. However, these effects are relatively minor.

Overall, while caffeine can have some minor effects on hormone levels and bone
density, it is important to keep in mind that these effects are relatively small
and can be mitigated by ensuring that you are getting enough calcium through
your diet.

*** Afternoon Caffeine & Sleep


Sleep is the foundation of mental and physical health, and it is essential to
getting enough quality sleep each night.

While it is understandable that some people may have difficulty getting enough
sleep, the goal should be to get enough quality sleep for 80% of the nights of
your life, and to make sure that the remaining 20% of nights without enough
sleep are for good reasons, such as child rearing.

To ensure that you get the best quality sleep, it is important to avoid caffeine
intake in the 12 hours prior to sleep.

This means that even if you are someone who can drink an espresso and fall right
asleep, you should still avoid caffeine in the 12 hours leading up to your
bedtime.

The ideal time to have your last caffeine intake is before noon, if you go to
sleep around 10 p.m. every night.

It is important to note that the quarter-life of caffeine is 12 hours, meaning
that 25% of its effects will still be active at midnight after you ingest it.

This can disrupt the early phase of your night, the amount of slow-wave sleep,
and the amount of rapid eye movement sleep. This can also disrupt your emotional
processing during the following day.

To avoid disrupting your sleep-wake cycle, it is best to avoid drinking caffeine
in the 12 hours prior to sleep, and if you can't do that, try to limit your
caffeine intake in the 8-12 hours prior to going to sleep at night.

Slow-wave sleep, also known as deep sleep, is the sleep associated with growth
hormone release, which is important for protein synthesis, repair of all bodily
tissues, and metabolism. It is also critically important for your immune
system's ability to clear out pathogens.

In summary, it is important to avoid caffeine intake in the 12 hours prior to
sleep, and to strive to get quality sleep most nights of your life.

This will ensure that you are able to get the benefits of deep sleep and the
release of growth hormones, which are essential for maintaining good physical
and mental health.

*** Caffeine, Performance & Menstrual Cycle


Caffeine is a widely used stimulant that can improve mental and physical
performance.

Some people may wonder if caffeine has different effects on the nervous system
and performance, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle.

Recent research has explored this question and found that caffeine can enhance
physical performance during all three phases of the menstrual cycle.

One study, entitled "Caffeine Consumption and Menstrual Function," looked at the
relationship between caffeine and menstrual function.

Another study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition in 2020, titled
"Ergogenic Effects of Caffeine on Peak Aerobic Cycling Power During the
Menstrual Cycle," found that caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power
during the early follicular, pre-ovulatory, and mid-luteal phases of the
menstrual cycle. The study used a dosage of 3 milligrams of caffeine per
kilogram of body mass.

The findings of these studies suggest that for women who are regular users of
caffeine or use caffeine to enhance physical performance, there does not seem to
be any menstrual cycle phase-dependent effects of caffeine on performance.

In other words, caffeine seems to always increase physical performance,
regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.

*** Caffeine & Naps


There is a trend known as the *nappuccino*, which involves drinking a cup of
coffee or double espresso and then taking a nap, typically in the afternoon,
with the idea that the caffeine will hit your system right when you wake up from
the nap and you will be better able to focus and exercise. However, there are a
few things that are not ideal about this practice.

First, it implies that in most cases, people are napping and ingesting caffeine
in the afternoon.

This is not ideal because caffeine can have sleep-diminishing effects and it is
better to restrict caffeine intake to the early part of the day.

The other reason is that the data on things like non-sleep deep rest and naps in
the afternoon shows that naps of 90 minutes or less, or non-sleep deep rest
protocols, can lead to increases in one of the catecholamines, dopamine, and can
improve mood, focus, and alertness on its own without the need to ingest
caffeine prior to going into those states.

In fact, ingesting caffeine prior to a nap or non-sleep deep rest will most
certainly reduce the effectiveness of the nap and non-sleep deep rest in
restoring natural levels of alertness and focus that would lead to the
performance-enhancing effect.

*** Dopamine Stacking

Dopamine stacking is a technique that involves combining various stimuli, such
as caffeine and exercise, to increase dopamine release in the brain.

This technique was discussed in an episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, which is
one of the most popular episodes on the show. The episode highlighted the fact
that while there are many things that can increase dopamine release, there are
also certain compounds and activities that can increase dopamine to varying
levels and to varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy.

However, for those who tend to experience difficulty with motivation, dopamine
stacking may not be the best approach.

Dopamine stacking can lead to a peak in dopamine levels, but it also leads to a
subsequent drop in dopamine levels below baseline.

This requires being able to tolerate a drop in dopamine baseline for a period of
time.

In the context of caffeine and exercise, a recent study has shown that using
caffeine prior to exercise increases dopamine after exercise.

While this may seem like dopamine stacking, it is important to keep in mind that
this should not be done consistently every time you exercise.

Instead, it should be done occasionally to increase mood, alertness, and
performance, or to condition yourself to increase your liking or even your love
of exercise.

However, it is important to be cautious when using caffeine before exercise and
to pay attention to how you feel in the hours and days after the dopamine
increase wears off.

If you experience a low after eight hours or the next day, it is best to avoid
doing the same thing again in the future.

*** Scheduling Caffeine to Maximize Its Effects

The schedule Huberman suggests is an every other day schedule, where you consume
caffeine on alternate days.

This is based on the half-life of caffeine, its effects on the dopamine system,
and its performance-enhancing effects.

He also suggests that a period of abstinence can increase the
performance-enhancing effects of caffeine.

Andrew Huberman himself has never tried an every other day caffeine approach,
but he is considering doing it based on the literature he has read.

He is also considering consuming caffeine only on the days when he resistance
trains, which he does about three or four days per week.

He believes that this schedule seems like the most rational one if one wants to
maximize the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine without suffering the
effects of caffeine withdrawal, such as headaches and irritability.

He encourages readers to try the every other day protocol and to let him know
their experiences with it.

*** Pro-Health Effects of Caffeine


One of the most well-established pro-health effects of caffeine is its ability
to lower the probability of developing Parkinson's and Alzheimer's related
dementia.

This is likely due to caffeine's ability to increase the release of
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that are known to be defective in these
diseases.

A 2016 review titled "The Neuroprotective Effects of Caffeine and
Neurodegenerative Diseases" provides an extensive overview of the studies in
animals and humans that support this claim.

Additionally, caffeine has been found to be effective in reducing headaches when
taken in combination with aspirin, and providing brief but substantial relief
from asthma.

However, it is important to note that caffeine should not be relied upon as a
life-saving approach for asthma attacks.

The recommended dosage for these pro-health effects is one to three milligrams
per kilogram of body weight.

*** Wrapping Up
Caffeine is a widely consumed substance that has numerous benefits for both
mental and physical performance. 

Studies have shown that caffeine increases neuromodulators such as dopamine and
norepinephrine, which are responsible for increasing alertness, motivation, and
drive. 

Additionally, caffeine has been shown to reduce reaction time, improve
endurance, and reduce muscle pain. 

Caffeine also acts as a powerful reinforcing agent, making the drink or food
that contains it more appealing and enhancing the experience of the person or
object associated with it. 

However, it is important to note that excessive caffeine intake can lead to
negative effects and it's important to consume it in moderation.
