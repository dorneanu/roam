- You have 25 cards
  - each one describes a real world phenomenon
    - how the Internet works
    - what are economic bubbles
  - each card falls into 2 categories
    - its domain (economy, IT etc.)
    - its deep structure
- The problem is that most people are not able to put the cards into the categories based on causality
- Only if you have a /range/ (broad) of domain knowledge, you'll be able to find good /deep structures/
- This ability [[id:7edf3e3e-42c0-4ec6-b8dc-a3e71210d116][Analogical thinking]] helps with categorizing the type of problem being faced
  - the best problem solvers begin with the typing of the problem
