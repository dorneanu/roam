Packet:

| Dst IP | Src. IP | Data | FCS |

** Example
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: example
:END:
We have 2 hosts: 10.10.10.1 (Host 1) and 10.10.10.2 (Host 2) with network mask 10.10.10.0/24. Both hosts are connected through a Layer 2 Switch.

| Host | MAC addr |
| 1    | AAAA     |
| 2    | BBBB     |

Host 1 generates an *ARP request* (broadcast) for the address 10.10.10.2 which means "How ever has this IP address please send me your MAC addr".

Host 2 receives the broadcast and find out its own IP is 10.10.10.2. So it generates an *ARP Reply*' (Unicast) where it sends its MAC address to Host 1.

This process will happen only once (at the beginning).
