- located at the base of the brain stem
- monitor changes of [[id:73226fcb-1702-4d6b-a4ba-b66bbae65c2a][Carbon Dioxide]] levels and send alarm signals to the brain, telling the lungs to breathe faster and more deeply
- when we're breathing too quickly, the receptors tell the body to breathe more slowly to increase [[id:73226fcb-1702-4d6b-a4ba-b66bbae65c2a][Carbon Dioxide]] levels
- *Chemoreception* is one the most fundamental functions of life
  - first aerobic life forms had to sense carbon dioxide to avoid it
  - as humans evolved chemoreception became more plastic
    - humans could adapt to changing environments
    - it it the ability to adapt to different levels of [[id:73226fcb-1702-4d6b-a4ba-b66bbae65c2a][Carbon Dioxide]] and oxygen that helped humans colonize at different (and high) altitudes
