- *adenosine triphosphate*
- delivers energy for different biological processes including muscle contraction
- exists in cells that are in an /anaerobic/ state ([[id:b1e8d890-e854-4785-88db-279de102b3e7][Anaerobic respiration]]) (w/o presence of oxygen)
  - but they multiply exponentially in cells in /aerobic/ state (with presence of oxygen)
- /aerobic dissimilation/ influences mitochondrial process and 30 x more ATP molecules are created when there is no oxygen
- by applying [[id:2965cd54-8ffb-48a1-9b88-07ca58f97469][The Wim Hof Method]] you can increase the amount of ATP in your cells
