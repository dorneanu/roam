  Happiness comes from within: _self-conained binaries_

  Go is _verb-oriented_. Put a pot on the stove. Boil water. Pour the water over some tea leaves. Wait. Drink. This is the way humans think. When planning a task, you think about the necessary actions before you think about the array of objects needed for executing these actions.


  Go's ‚Äú*do something*‚Äù approach gets your *stuff done.*


  The =net/http= package allows building a basic *HTTP server* with a *few lines of code*.

  Go has quite a unique approach of *abstracting away data sources and sinks as uniform data streams*. An =io.Reader= stream, for example, can represent input from a file, a network connection, an in-memory buffer, or even a simple string. Unit-test your code with a byte buffer, then use it in production with real files.

  Go-specific things:
  - understand the different usage scenarios for channels
  - demonstrable knowledge of the net/http interfaces and their common implementations
  - demonstrable knowledge of the io interfaces and their common implementations
  - the ability to demonstrate when and how a goroutine will end
  - demonstrable knowledge of common pitfalls (e.g. closing a response body, variable shadowing, etc)
  - demonstrate you can write code that respects context cancellation
  - knowledge and demonstrated proficiency with standard tooling in the Go sdk
  - slice internals
  - map internals

  In addition to all of that:
  - channel internals,
  - scheduler
  - garbage collection
  - concurrency patterns
  - understanding advantages and disadvantages of go and it's history (will help you understand why it was designed that way and avoid a huge ton of pitfalls)

  Let's Go teaches you step-by-step how to create fast, secure and maintainable web applications using the fantastic programming language Go.

  The idea behind the book is to help you learn by doing. Together we'll walk through the start-to-finish build of a complete web application ‚Äî from structuring your workspace, through to session management, authenticating users, securing your server and testing your application.

  Building a complete web application has a number of benefits: it helps put the things you're learning into context, demonstrates how different parts of your codebase link together, and forces us to work through the edge-cases and difficulties that come up when writing software in real-life. In essence, you'll learn more that you would by just reading Go's (great) documentation or standalone blog posts.

  Although you can read the book cover-to-cover, it's designed specifically for you to follow along and build the application yourself.
  Break out your text editor, and happy coding!
