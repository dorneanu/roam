  Happiness comes from within: _self-conained binaries_

  Go is _verb-oriented_. Put a pot on the stove. Boil water. Pour the water over some tea leaves. Wait. Drink. This is the way humans think. When planning a task, you think about the necessary actions before you think about the array of objects needed for executing these actions.


  Go's ‚Äú*do something*‚Äù approach gets your *stuff done.*


  The =net/http= package allows building a basic *HTTP server* with a *few lines of code*.

  Go has quite a unique approach of *abstracting away data sources and sinks as uniform data streams*. An =io.Reader= stream, for example, can represent input from a file, a network connection, an in-memory buffer, or even a simple string. Unit-test your code with a byte buffer, then use it in production with real files.

  Go-specific things:
  - understand the different usage scenarios for channels
  - demonstrable knowledge of the net/http interfaces and their common implementations
  - demonstrable knowledge of the io interfaces and their common implementations
  - the ability to demonstrate when and how a goroutine will end
  - demonstrable knowledge of common pitfalls (e.g. closing a response body, variable shadowing, etc)
  - demonstrate you can write code that respects context cancellation
  - knowledge and demonstrated proficiency with standard tooling in the Go sdk
  - slice internals
  - map internals
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
  In addition to all of that:
  - channel internals,
  - scheduler
  - garbage collection
  - concurrency patterns
  - understanding advantages and disadvantages of go and it's history (will help you understand why it was designed that way and avoid a huge ton of pitfalls)
