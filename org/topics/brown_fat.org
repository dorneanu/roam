#+type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

- plays a key role (for babies) in /thermoregulation/ and /thermogenesis/
  - heat is created when babies become cold because they're not able to move around as adults can
- white fat stores energy
  - but /brown/ fat is capable of energy combustion
- as we grow the amount of brown fat decreases because of climate-controller lifestyle
