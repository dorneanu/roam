- Test doubles
  - Traditionally, there are five types of *test doubles*:
    - Dummies: Types without any behavior at all, provided only because the signature of the unit under test requires them.
    - Stubs: Types implementing the minimum amount of behavior to satisfy a test.
    - Mocks: Partial implementations for which you can define expectations on how their methods will be called.
    - Spies: Partial implementations on which you can assert that specific methods have been called.
    - *Fakes*: Full, lightweight implementations such as in-memory databases.
