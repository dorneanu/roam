* Network Security
- physical env security
- logical network security
  - security of link, protocol and application layer services
* Cryptography
- encryption
  - data in transit
  - data at rest
  - key management
** Key management
- remote key management service (also see [[id:e8fc9b18-1674-4358-ad10-10ba8e675469][AWS/KMS]])
- client-side key management
* Access control
- IAM :: includes people, processes and systems that are used to manage access to enterprise resources (also see [[#AWS%2FIAM][AWS/IAM]])
* Data and Media Sanitization
- Vendor lock-in :: highlights where a customer may be unable to leave, migrate, or transfer to an alternate provider due to technical or nontechnical constraints
* Virtualization Security
- Hypervisors

- Type 1 hypervisors :: running directly on the hardware with VMs resources provided by the hypervisor. "Bare metal" hypervisors (examples: VMWare ESXi, Citrix [[#XenServer][XenServer]])
- Type 2 hypervisors :: run on a operating system to provide virtualization services (examples: VMWare Workstation, [[#VirtualBox][VirtualBox]])

* Common Threats
- Data Breaches
- Data Loss
- Account or Service Traffic Hijacking
- Insecure Interfaces and APIs
- Denial of Service
- Malicious Insiders
- Abuse of Cloud Services
- Insufficient Due Diligence
  - not understanding the risks
- Shared Technology Vulnerabilites
