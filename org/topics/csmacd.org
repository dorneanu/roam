- CSMA/CD :: Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection

Following steps:

- A device with a frame to send listens until the Ethernet is not busy
- When the Ethernet is not busy, the sender begins sending the frame
- The sender listens if a collision occurs, If this is the case, all currently sending nodes do the following:
  - they send a jamming signal that tells that a collision happened
  - they independently chose a random time to wait before trying again
- the next steps start again at Step 1
