#+title: Progressive Summarization

* Different Layers of Highlighting
- Layer 1: When you encounter something interesting, *capture* it
- Layer 2: *Bold* the most interesting parts
- Layer 3: *Highlight* the most interesting bolded sections
- Layer 4: *Summarize the bolded portions* and the note in your own words
- Layer 5: Turn your notes *into something new*: a tweet, a blog post, even a book

Each layer should include *no more than 10-20% of the previous layer*.

  #+begin_quote
  There are some highly desirable *characteristics* of progressive summarization:

  - *just in time vs ahead of time*: you only do the work when you need to
  - *incremental work*: you only do minimal work at each layer which can then be leveraged in later layers
  - *active vs passive*: you actively read the text instead of skimming it
