#+title: Progressive Summarization

* Different Layers of Highlighting
- Layer 1: When you encounter something interesting, capture it
- Layer 2: Bold the most interesting parts
- Layer 3: Highlight the most interesting bolded sections
- Layer 4: Summarize the bolded portions and the note in your own words
- Layer 5: Turn your notes into something new: a tweet, a blog post, even a book

Each layer should include *no more than 10-20% of the previous layer*.
