#+title: eBPF

- Kernel side
  - either in C or [[id:cdf2a03e-f080-4e6f-8636-7c0f582d91fc][Rust]]
- userland (more programming languages)
- applications loaded directly into the kernel
- more secure than kernel modules since there is a verifier which does basic checks against the eBPF bytecode
- also Docker uses eBPF technologies under the hood
