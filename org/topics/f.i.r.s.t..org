- fast: tests should be fast
- independent: tests should not depenend on each other
  - one test should not set up the conditions for the next test
  - test should be run independently and in any order you like
- repeatable: tests should be runnable in any environment
  - if your tests aren't repeatable in any environment they you always have an excuse why the fail
- self-validating: the tests should have a boolean output
  - test either pass or fail
- timely: test need to be written in a timely fashion
  - unit tests should be written just before the production code that makes them pass
  - if you write tests after production, then you may find the production code to be hard to test
  - you may even decide that production code is not testable
