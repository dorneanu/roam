* Classles IP Addressing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: classles-ip-addressing
:END:
** Example: Let's suppose we need only 30 IP address
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: example-lets-suppose-we-need-only-30-ip-address
:END:
IP range = 150.101.45.0/27

*How do we get?*:

- Network address
- Valid IP range
- Broadcast address

** Network address
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: network-address
:END:

--------------

The network address is simply 150.101.45.0

** Network mask
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: network-mask
:END:

--------------

First 3 octets are set --> Netmask = 255.255.255.*224*

because 3 bits set correspond to:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 1   | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

and if we had those values we get *224*.

** Block size
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: block-size
:END:

--------------

The *last* value of the Bit turned out gives the the *Block Size*. In our case:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 1   | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

** Valid IP range
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: valid-ip-range
:END:

--------------

The *first* valid IP address is 150.101.45.1. The *last* possible IP address is 150.101.45.30 (*Block Size* - 2).

** Broadcast adress
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: broadcast-adress
:END:

--------------

The *broadcast address* is 150.101.45.31 (*Block Size* - 1)

**** Use the formula
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: use-the-formula
:END:

--------------

We have 5 host bits since:

| 128     | 64 | 32   | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 1       | 1  | 1    | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Network |    | Host |    |   |   |   |   |

2^5 - 2 = 30 Possible IP addresses

** Supposing we have 150.101.45.0/30
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: supposing-we-have-150.101.45.030
:END:
This way you'll get only 2 valid IP addresses. This CIDR is used in *point-to-point* connection (e.g.Â between routers).

*** What is the valid host range for 150.101.64.0/19
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-is-the-valid-host-range-for-150.101.64.019
:END:
Network mask is. 255.255.224.0

The block size is: 32

We have following networks/subnets (each time we had the block size):

| # Network | Beginning       |
| 1         | 150.101.0.0/19  |
| 2         | 150.101.32.0/19 |
| 3         | 150.101.64.0/19 |
| 4         | 150.101.96.0/19 |

So the first valid IP address for 150.101.64.0/19 starts at *150.101.64.0/19* and ends at *150.101.95.255* (150.101.96.0/19 is the next network).

But since the last IP address is the *broadcast* address we have these valid IP range: *150.101.64.1 - 150.101.95.224*
