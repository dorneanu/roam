- Introduced by David Parnas in "Information Distribution Aspects of Design Methodology"
- hide as many details as possible behind a module / microservice boundary
- Parnas identified following benefits:
  - improved development time
  - comprehensibility
    - each module is isolated and therefore better to understand
  - flexibility
