- concept of prana was documented around the same time in India and China (3000 years ago)
- the Chinese called it *chi*
  - they believed the body has channels that connect organs and tissues (as prana power lines)
- the Japanese had *ki*
- the Greeks had *pneuma*
- Hebrews *ruah*
- over the years cultures have developed lots of methods to maintain a steady flow of prana
  - acupuncture
  - yoga (postures)
  - spicy foods also contain large doses of prana
  - but the most poweful technique was to *inhale* prana
- in Hinduismus it means life or life energy
