As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, /The Talent Code/, these scientists
increasingly believe the answer includes [[id:c2bbb018-15e5-4a0d-a071-aee390d0a6fe][myelin]] --- a layer of fatty tissue that grows
around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster andcleaner.
To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mindthat skills, be they
intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down tobrain circuits. This new science of
performance argues that you getbetter at a skill as you develop more myelin around the
relevantneurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and
effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated.
