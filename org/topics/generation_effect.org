- Learning is the sequence of generating answers on your own (even false ones)
- This (intentionally) sacrifices performance (and speed) for future benefit
- You're basically forced to generate answers (to a problem)
- This also leads to a "hypercorrection effect"
  - the more confident one is that the answer is wrong, the better the information sticks when they /subsequently/ learn the right answer
- Children should therefor be motivated to do mistakes ([[#Das%20kompetente%20Kind][Das kompetente Kind]])
