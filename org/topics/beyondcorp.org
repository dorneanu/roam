#+begin_quote
BeyondCorp is Google's implementation of the zero trust security model that
builds upon eight years of building zero trust networks at Google, combined with
ideas and best practices from the community. By shifting access controls from
the network perimeter to individual users and devices, BeyondCorp allows
employees, contractors, and other users to work more securely from virtually any
location without the need for a traditional VPN. -- [[https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp][BeyondCorp at Google]]

* [[https://research.google/pubs/pub43231/][Beyond Corp: A new approach to enterprise security]]
- The perimeter security model is often compared to a medieval castle
- access depends solely on device and user credentials, regard-less of a user’s network location—be it an enterprise location, a home network, or a hotel or coffee shop
* [[https://research.google/pubs/pub44860/][Beyond Corp: Design to Deployment at Google]]
- access policies are based on information about a device, its state, and its associated user
- use of X.509 certificates as a persistent device identifier
* [[https://research.google/pubs/pub45728/][Beyond Corp: The Access proxy]]
- Google implemented a centralized policy enforcement front-end Access Proxy (AP) to handle coarse-grained company policies.
- implemented for HTTP and [[id:2ed249d7-cb50-423a-be6e-cde00f156138][SSH]]
  - wrap [[id:2ed249d7-cb50-423a-be6e-cde00f156138][SSH]] traffic in HTTP over [[id:4a08aa51-44d3-46e1-a2c3-14f51a97220b][TLS]] (by using ProxyCommand)
  - they developed a local proxy, similar to Corkscrew
- The main components of Google’s front-end infrastructure are a f leet of HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxies called Google Front Ends
- authentication:
  - support [[id:092b8fa4-0199-438f-9f4a-56bde0302ff1][OAUTH]], [[id:a22ff8d7-3a64-4725-afce-597573aa98d3][OpenID]] connect and custom protocols
- authorization:
  - ACL engine queryable via RPCs
