Welcome, bine ai venit, willkommen! My name is [[#VictorDorneanu][Victor Dorneanu]] and this is the place where I store my so called *external brain*. This project is aimed at collecting almost everything I know or try to remember. What you see right now is basically my personal knowledge base built with [[#Tiddlywiki][Tiddlywiki]].

Although I still haven't figured out how to perfectly structure my notes, quotes and these are some areas you can read about:

- [[#ProgrammingLanguage][Coding]]
  - At the moment I mainly develop in [[#Golang][Golang]] and [[#Python][Python]]
  - I like to run my code in a [[#Serverless][Serverless]] environment

  - You can check my code at [[https://github.com/dorneanu][github.com/dorneanu]] or [[https://gitlab.com/vdorneanu][gitlab.com/vdorneanu]]
- [[#Security][Security]]
  - This is such a huge area so I specialized in [[#AppSec][Application Security]]
  - I try to understand the mathematical concepts behing [[#Cryptography][Cryptography]]
