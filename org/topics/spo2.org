Oxygen saturation (Sp02) is the percentage of oxygen-c√°rrying red blood cells ([[#Hemoglobin][hemoglobin]] molecules) containing oxygen within the blood. During periods of rest the standard breathing volume for a healthy person is between 4 and 6 liters of air per minute, which results in almost complete oxygen saturation of 95 to 99 percent
