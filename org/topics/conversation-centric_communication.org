#+type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

- conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship
  - conversation has to match [[#Sherry%20Turkle][Sherry Turkle]]'s criteria of involving nuanced analog cues
    - tone of your voice
    - facial expression
  - anything textual or non-interactive (social media, email, text instant messaging) counts more as a *"mere connection"*
  - digital tools can help to arrange conversations
