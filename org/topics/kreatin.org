* Dosages
- Based on Body Weight: For a person weighing around 180 pounds, *5 grams per
  day is recommended*. Heavier individuals may need 10-15 grams, while those
  lighter might need 1-5 grams.
- No Loading Phase Needed: Contrary to early beliefs, a high dosage loading
  phase isn't necessary; benefits can be achieved at consistent lower dosages.
* Effects
** Cognitive performance and brain health
- Neuronal Fuel Source: Creatine also serves as a fuel source for neurons,
  potentially enhancing cognitive functions.
- Traumatic Brain Injury: There are indications that creatine might aid
  cognition after traumatic brain injury, though medical consultation is advised
** Physical Performance
- Increased Power Output: Studies show creatine can increase power output in
  activities like sprinting, running, jumping, and weightlifting by 1% to 20%.
- Hydration and Muscle Mass: Creatine enhances the body's ability to hydrate
  cells, indirectly aiding in muscle mass increase.
- Reduction in Fatigue: Multiple studies indicate creatine's role in reducing
  fatigue.
** Other effects
- Influence on Hormones: Creatine can increase levels of dihydrotestosterone
  (DHT), a potent androgen, which might affect strength, libido, and hair
  patterns.
- Varied Effects on Hair Growth: While some may experience hair loss or
  accelerated beard growth, these effects are not universal.
