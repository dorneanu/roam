From a basic point of view, a leased line WAN works a lot like an Ethernet crossover cable connecting two routers, but with few distance limitations. Each router can send at any time (full-duplex) over the leased line, for tens, hundreds, or even thousands of miles.

- leased line :: Nowadays the term /service provider/ is rather used

*** Leased Line Service

Used 2 pairs of wires (full-duplex)

- sending
- receiving

** Components
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: components
:END:
- CSU/DSU :: Channel Service Unit / Data Service Unit
  Can be integrated into the router (serial interface)
  Or external
- CPE :: Customer Premises Equipment

Connected using [[#Serial%20Connections][Serial Connections]].

** Data Link Details
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: data-link-details
:END:
A leased line provides a [[#Layer%201][Layer 1]] service. The most popular data link protocols for leased lines between 2 routers are:

- [[#HDLC][HDLC]]
- Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)

*** HDLC Encapsulation

** Service Provider
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: service-provider

Inside the SP's network , the SP uses any technology that it wants to create the specific Ethernet WAN service.

** Ethernet WAN Service
:PROPERTIES:

Goes by 2 names

- Ethernet emulation
- Ethernet over MPLS

- Ethernet emulation service :: service acts like one Ethernet link
- MPLS :: Multi Protocol Label Switching
  [[#PoP][PoP]]
  Point of Presence

*[[#EoMPLS][EoMPLS]]* provides:

- a point-to-point connection between 2 customer devices
- behaviour as if a fiber Ethernet link existed between the 2 devices

2 routers =R1= and =R2= connect with an [[#EoMPLS][EoMPLS]] service instead of a serial link. The routers use Ethernet interfaces, and they can send data in both directions at the same time. Physically, each router connects to some SP *[[#PoP][PoP]]* but logically the 2 routers cand send Ethernet frames to each other over the link.

*** Packet routing
:PROPERTIES:

*Atention*: Although each router is using 802.3 encapsulation, each router discards the old data link header/trailer and add its own ones
