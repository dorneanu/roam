- Role
  - define a blueprint for what needs to be built

  - ensure the team has enough details to get the job done

  - guides the rest of the team toward this design during execution

  - talks to stakeholders

  - it's possible to do the architect's job w/o coding:

    - one must understand the low-level details, constraints and complexity

    #+begin_quote
    First of all, a software architect is a programmer; and continues to be a programmer. Never fall for the lie that suggests that software architects pull back from code to focus on higher-level issues. They do not! Software architects are the best programmers, and they continue to take programming tasks, while they also guide the rest of the team toward a design that maximizes productivity. Software architects may not write as much code as other programmers do, but they continue to engage in programming tasks.

    #+end_quote

  - create a shape for the system that recognizes [[#Software%20Architecture][policy]] as the most essential element while making the details irrelevant

    - this also allows decisions about the details to be delayed and deferred

  - takes late decisions and shapes the [[#Software%20System][Software System]] in a way that decisions can still be deferred or changed for as long as possible

    - also maximizes number of decisions not made
