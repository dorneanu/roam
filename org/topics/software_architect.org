- Role
  - define a blueprint for what needs to be built
  - ensure the team has enough details to get the job done
  - guides the rest of the team toward this design during execution
  - talks to stakeholders
  - it's possible to do the architect's job w/o coding:
    - one must understand the low-level details, constraints and complexity

    First of all, a software architect is a programmer; and continues to be a
    programmer. Never fall for the lie that suggests that software architects
    pull back from code to focus on higher-level issues. They do not! Software
    architects are the best programmers, and they continue to take programming
    tasks, while they also guide the rest of the team toward a design that
    maximizes productivity. Software architects may not write as much code as
    other programmers do, but they continue to engage in programming tasks.
    #+end_quote
  - create a shape for the system that recognizes policy as the most essential element while making the details irrelevant
    - this also allows decisions about the details to be delayed and deferred
  - takes late decisions and shapes the [[id:5d1db4fd-d8b7-4660-a706-8254efd6249d][Software System]] in a way that decisions can still be deferred or changed for as long as possible
    - also maximizes number of decisions not made
