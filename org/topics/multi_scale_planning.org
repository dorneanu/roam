#+title: Multi-scale planning

* From Top-Performer-Course:
** Concepts
- Multiscale Time Planning
  - The concept involves planning at *multiple time scales*, including monthly/quarterly, weekly, and daily
  - This approach helps to increase the level of detail as you move from larger to smaller scales, which is essential for effective time management.

- Flexibility and Adaptability
  - A crucial principle of multiscale planning is the understanding that *plans are not static*
  - They should be *flexible and adaptable* to changes
  - Adjusting plans as needed is expected, not a deviation from the strategy.
  - You don't get extra points for sticking to the plan

- Monthly/Quarterly Planning
  - This scale is vital for avoiding *deadline-driven* chaos
  - It allows for advanced preparation and scheduling to *meet major deadlines* and handle significant tasks efficiently.
  - It involves breaking down tasks week by week and maintaining a freestyle format for each week's notes, focusing on the big picture and major upcoming events or deadlines.

- Weekly and Daily Planning
  - These scales involve more detailed planning
  - Weekly plans describe scheduled *commitments and tasks for each day of the week*
  - Daily planning is the most detailed, assigning specific tasks to each hour of the day, thus providing control over daily activities

** Benefits
- Control Over Time
  - The goal of multiscale planning is to exert control over one's time, treating each commitment and task like chess pieces on a board, moving them around strategically
  - This approach enables one to be proactive rather than reactive, maximizing the use of time.
- Consistent Progress on Important Tasks
  - By controlling time at various scales and staying adaptable, consistent progress can be made on important but non-urgent tasks.
  - This method is particularly effective for projects that contribute significantly to personal and professional growth.
