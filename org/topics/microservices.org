The basic concept of a microservice is simple---it's a simple, standalone application that does one thing only and does that one thing well. The objective is to retain the simplicity, isolation, and productivity of the early app. A microservice cannot live alone; no microservice is an island---it is part of a larger system, running and working alongside other microservices to accomplish what would normally be handled by one large standalone application.

* Definition
- Each microservice is:
  - autonomous
  - independent
  - self-contained
  - and individually deployable
  - and scalable.
* Concepts
- Independent deployability
  - criteria for this: make sure microservices are loosely coupled
    - be able to change one service without having to change anything else
- Modeled around a business domain
  - definition of service boundaries (see [[id:7c4e66f6-ce2d-441b-8c33-51ba6aec412c][DDD]])
- Owning their own state
  - hide internal state (same as encapsulation in [[id:67ed9b34-5527-4d13-ba77-6dacc5d47df3][OOP]])
  - clean delineation between internal implementation details and external contract
    - be backward-compatible
  - hide database that backs the service
    - avoid DB showing
- Size
  #+begin_quote
  "A microservice should be as big as my head" - James Lewis
  #+end_quote
    - keep it to the size at which it can be easily understood
- Flexibility
  #+begin_quote
  "Microservices buy you options" - James Lewis
  #+end_quote
    - they have a cost and you must decide whether the cost is worth the options you want to take up
- Alignment of architecture and organization
  #+begin_quote
  - "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of the organization" - Melvin Conway
  #+end_quote
  - have team vertically organized
    - same team owns front-end, business logic, data, back-end, security
      - a so called stream-aligned team
* Advantages
  - use the componentization strategy
    - divide and rule more effectively
    - with clear boundaries between components.
  - create the right tool for each job in a microservice
  - testability
  - improved developer productivity and feature velocity.
