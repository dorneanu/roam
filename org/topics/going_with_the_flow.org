Going with the flow" is a concept popularized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,former head of the department of psychology at the University of Chicago.Csikszentmihalyi described "flow" as the experience of"being completely involved in an activity for its own sake.Self-consciousness falls away.Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost." This mental state is also sometimes described as being in the zone or the present moment.
