- Definition and usage
  - Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems in software engineering. Rather thanÂ a comprehensive solution, a design pattern is a description of a problem and a template of how to solve it. This template then becomes usable in many different contexts.
- Idea:
  - study the problem and the solutions
  - goal is to identify patterns among your requirements and architecture
  - use pre-conceived solutions to the problem
  - if design is composed of well-known patterns, it's easy to:
    - share idea
    - communicate and discuss with other stakeholders
