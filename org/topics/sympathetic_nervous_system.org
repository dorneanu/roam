#+title: Sympathetic Nervous System
#+type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

- send stimulating signals to our organs, telling them to get ready for action
- nerves of this system are spread out at the top of the lungs
  - when we take short, hasty breaths, the molecules of air activate the sympathetic nerves
- sympathetic stress takes just seconds to activate, turning it off and becoming again calm can take a hour or more
