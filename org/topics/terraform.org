 Which files:
 #+begin_quote
 - ~provider.tf~: contains the terraform block and provider block
 - ~data.tf~: contains all data sources
 - ~variables.tf:~ contains all defined variables
 - ~locals.tf~: contains all local variables
 - ~output.tf~: contains all output resources
 #+end_quote

 Locals vs variables:
 #+begin_quote
 - *variable blocks*: should be used for values that are not known beforehand, such IDs that are defined at runtime.
 - *Local blocks*: should be used for values that are known beforehand, but are good to abstract as variables, such as constants
 #+end_quote

 Use ~yamldecode~ to load a YAML file with all the settings (instead of defining everything in the TF file)
