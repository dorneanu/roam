- so called happiness hormone
- can't pass the blood-brain barrier (that is means you cannot influence it by dietary sources)
  - but tryptophan (building block of serotonin??) can do so
- turns out [[#Kohlenhydrate][carbohydrates]] ingestion shunts non-trytophan amino acids out from the blood and into the muscles (and that allows tryptophan greater access into the brain)
