- Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance :: an email validation system designed to protect your company's email domain from being used for email spoofing, phishing scams and other cybercrimes. DMARC leverages the existing email authentication techniques [[#SPF][SPF]] (Sender Policy Framework) [[#DKIM][DKIM]] (Domain Keys Identified Mail). DMARC adds an important function, reporting. When a domain owner publishes a DMARC record into their [[#DNS][DNS]] record, they will gain insight in who is sending email on behalf of their domain. This information can be used to get detailed information about the email channel. With this information a domain owner can get control over the email sent on his behalf. You can use DMARC to protect your domains against abuse in phishing or spoofing attacks.
