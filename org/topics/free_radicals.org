Free radicals are molecules generated by the breakdown of oxygen during
metabolic activity. We all create a certain amount of free radicals through the
very act of breathing, but normal levels do not pose a problem since the body's
defense mechanism is able to neutralize the molecules with [[id:cdd45bc1-438b-43e1-9f69-e10bf519f7be][antioxidants]] such as
glutathione, ubiquinone, flavonoids, and vitamins [[id:e5172ed4-5152-4ac2-985d-674fe8a7ea87][A]], E, and [[id:9387fcda-83c7-45aa-bbcd-87361a49cb49][C]]. But when our
antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed by too many free radicals, cells can be
damaged and our health adversely affected. This is what is known as oxidative
stress.
