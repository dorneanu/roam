-   The Gap instinct
    -   Look for the majority
    -   People have a binary perspective of the world
    -   There are 4 levels/categories how world population should be splitted to (based on income per day) (Souce: <https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels>)
        -   Level 1 (0-2 $)
            -   1 Billion people
        -   Level 2 (2-8 $)
            -   3 Billions people
        -   Level 3 (8-32 $)

        -   most of the time you have an overlap
    -   look for the majority
        -   don't compare averages
        -   don't compare extremes (majority is usually somewhere in between where the gap should be)

        -   When someone says that a majority of a group has some property it can sound like most of them have something in common. Remember that majority just means more than half. It could mean 51%. It could mean 99%. If possible, ask for the percentage.

#### Factfulness - Note 1 {#factfulness-note-1}

> Take for example, girl's education. Educating girls has proven to be one the world's best-ever ideas. When women are educated, all kinds of wonderful things happen in societies. The workforce becomes diversified and able to make better decisions and solve more problems. Educated mothers decide to have fewer children and more children survive. More energy and time is invested in each child's education. It's a virtuous cycle of change.
