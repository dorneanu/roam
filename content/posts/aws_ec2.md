-   on-demand
    -   fixed by rate hour/seconds
    -   **low cost and flexible**

    -   used for **web servers**
    -   ready state or **predictable** usage
    -   **up-front payments**
-   spot
    -   enables you to bid whatever price you want

    -   urgent need for large amounts of extra capacity
-   dedicated hosts
    -   like dedicated servers
    -   helps you w/ licensing
    -   for regulatory requirements (e.g.Â multi-tenant virtualization)

### Clustered {#clustered}

-   grouping of instances within a single AZ
-   recommended for apps that need low latency, high net throughput
-   only certain instances can be launched
-   for big data
-   can't span multiple AZ


### Spread {#spread}

-   group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware
-   recommended for applications that small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other
