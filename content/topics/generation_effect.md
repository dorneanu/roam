-   Learning is the sequence of generating answers on your own (even false ones)
-   This (intentionally) sacrifices performance (and speed) for future benefit
-   You're basically forced to generate answers (to a problem)
-   This also leads to a "hypercorrection effect"
    -   the more confident one is that the answer is wrong, the better the information sticks when they _subsequently_ learn the right answer
-   Children should therefor be motivated to do mistakes ()
