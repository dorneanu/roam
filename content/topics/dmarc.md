Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance
: an email validation system designed to protect your company's email domain from being used for email spoofing, phishing scams and other cybercrimes. DMARC leverages the existing email authentication techniques (Sender Policy Framework) (Domain Keys Identified Mail). DMARC adds an important function, reporting. When a domain owner publishes a DMARC record into their record, they will gain insight in who is sending email on behalf of their domain. This information can be used to get detailed information about the email channel. With this information a domain owner can get control over the email sent on his behalf. You can use DMARC to protect your domains against abuse in phishing or spoofing attacks.
