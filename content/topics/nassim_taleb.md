Nassim Taleb spends 30 hours every week reading books.

> 1.  The minute I was bored with a book or a subject I moved to another one, instead of
>     giving up on reading altogether.
>
> 2.  The trick is to be bored with a specific book, rather than with the act of reading.
>
> 3.  A good book gets better at the second reading. A great book at the third. Any book not
>     worth rereading isn’t worth reading.
>
> 4.  I follow the Lindy effect as a guide in selecting what to read: books that have been
>     around for ten years will be around for ten more; books that have been around for two
>     millennia should be around for quite a bit of time, and so forth.
>
> 5.  The reading of a single text twice is more profitable than reading two different things
>     once.
>
> 6.  A private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool.
>
> 7.  Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much
>     of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently
>     tight real-estate market allows you to put there.
>
> 8.  Drink old wine. Read old books. Keep old friends.
>
> 9.  Read nothing from the past one hundred years.
>
> 10. Never read a book that can be adequately summarized.
>
> 11. Never read a book you would not reread.
>
> 12. No book that can be shortened survives.
>
> 13. Books that endure don't look like good books; they are almost always very poorly
>     written, but address fundamental topics.
>
> 14. What matters for a book is depth and relevance, which is extremely rare. Plus
>     internal, not external coherence. Books that have them don't need the cosmetic shit.
>
> 15. When a risk taker writes a book, read it. In the case of Peter Thiel, read it twice.
>
> 16. Keep the book. Easier to remember contents just by looking at it. Often not even
>     necessary to consult notes.
>
> 17. I don't remember what I learned in class. I remember much of what I read on my own.
>
> 18. To become a scholar, spend decades reading 30-40 h/week.
>
> 19. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing
>     number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more
>     you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread
>     books an antilibrary.
>
> 20. I don’t read newspapers. I don’t watch television. I’m not on Facebook. I don’t care
>     for the social networks. I’m on Twitter, but I use it only as a means to an end. I
>     read books.
>
> 21. Books are not read by the majority because they read the Internet, which is like junk
>     food for the mind.
>
> 22. The unread books on your shelf are like a universe of alternate possibilities waiting
>     to be explored.
>
> 23. I divide my spirits into two categories: those I read for the pleasure of reading and
>     those I read for the pleasure of rereading.
>
> 24. To see if a book is real, ask 10 people of different backgrounds &amp; professions to
>     summarize it. If the summaries are similar, the book will not survive as it can be
>     shortened to a journal article.
>
> The more the summaries diverge, the higher the dimensionality of the book.
>
> 1.  If you want to study classical values such as courage or learn about stoicism, don’t
>     necessarily look for classicists. One is never a career academic without a reason.
>     Read the texts themselves: Seneca, Caesar, or Marcus Aurelius, when possible. Or read
>     commentators on the classics who were doers themselves, such as Montaigne—people who
>     at some point had some skin in the game, then retired to write books. Avoid the
>     intermediary, when possible.
>
> 2.  Criticism, for a book, is a truthful, unfaked badge of attention, signaling that it is
>     not boring; and boring is the only very bad thing for a book. Consider the Ayn Rand
>     phenomenon: her books Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead have been read for more than
>     half a century by millions of people, in spite of, or most likely thanks to, brutally
>     nasty reviews and attempts to discredit her.
>
> 3.  A novel you like resembles a friend. You read it and reread it, getting to know it
>     better. Like a friend, you accept it the way it is; you do not judge it.
