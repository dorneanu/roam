## Deliberate Practice {#deliberate-practice}

-   Part of performance psychology
-   In the early 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University
-   Key components
    -   (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or
        an idea you're trying to master;
    -   (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention
        exactly where it's most productive


### Neurological aspects {#neurological-aspects}

> As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, _The Talent Code_, these scientists
> increasingly believe the answer includes [myelin]({{< relref "myelin.md" >}}) --- a layer of fatty tissue that grows
> around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster andcleaner.
> To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mindthat skills, be they
> intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down tobrain circuits. This new science of
> performance argues that you getbetter at a skill as you develop more myelin around the
> relevantneurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and
> effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated.
