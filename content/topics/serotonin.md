-   so called happiness hormone
-   can't pass the blood-brain barrier (that is means you cannot influence it by dietary sources)
    -   but tryptophan (building block of serotonin??) can do so
-   turns out ingestion shunts non-trytophan amino acids out from the blood and into the muscles (and that allows tryptophan greater access into the brain)
