-   CD is set of capabilities to enable changes of all kinds (features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments) go into production "safely", "quickly" and "suistanably"
-   Principles
    -   Build quality in
        -   Eliminate the need for mass inspection by building quality into the product in the first place
        -   invest a culture supported by tools and people where issues can be detected quickly
        -   issues should be fixed straight away when they're cheap to detect and resolve
    -   Work in small batches
        -   split work in smaller chunks that deliver measurable business outcomes on a small part of the market
        -   through feedback the course can be corrected
        -   also a key goal is to change the economics of the software delivery process in order to minimize the cost of cost of changes
    -   Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems
        -   take long repetitive work (testing, deployments) and invest in simplyfing and automating this work
        -   this way "people" have more time for problem-solving work
    -   Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement
        -   high-performers are never satisfied
        -   they make improvement part of their daily work and culture
    -   Everyone is responsible
        -   everyone involved in the software delivery process has to work together
-   In order to implement CD following foundations should be created
    -   Comprehensive configuration management
        -   build, test and deploy software fully in an automated manner from information stored in a version control system
        -   any changes should be applied in the version control
