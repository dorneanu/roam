-   2023-05-15 ◦ [Serverless, a CTO’s Perspective - DEV Community](https://dev.to/aws-builders/serverless-a-ctos-perspective-3hpc)

    > As many others have stated, it's **not the absence of servers** that makes it
    > serverless, it's the **place in your problem-solving and deployment** that makes it
    > so.

    > So why would a CTO choose serverless from a people perspective? For me it's
    > simple. With serverless I **spend less time running infrastructure and more time
    > building application**

    <!--quoteend-->

    > I tend to book **serverless components in two categories**. I have the **bedrock
    > components** that I know I won't need to outgrow such as [SQS]({{< relref "aws.md#sqs" >}}), DyanmoDB and
    > EventBridge. And then I have **the components that get me going the quickest and
    > will last a long time but might be replaced**. Step Functions and [Lambda]({{< relref "awslambda.md" >}})s fall
    > into the this category. I've not reached a scale that requires this in a few
    > places but the upgrade path is easy enough. I lean into Fargate on ECS which
    > gives me plenty of horizontal scale to deal with load that might be more
    > consistent.
