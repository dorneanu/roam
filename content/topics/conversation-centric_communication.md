-   conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship
    -   conversation has to match 's criteria of involving nuanced analog cues
        -   tone of your voice
        -   facial expression
    -   anything textual or non-interactive (social media, email, text instant messaging) counts more as a **"mere connection"**
    -   digital tools can help to arrange conversations
