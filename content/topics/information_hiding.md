-   Introduced by David Parnas in "Information Distribution Aspects of Design Methodology"
-   hide as many details as possible behind a module / microservice boundary
-   Parnas identified following benefits:
    -   improved development time
    -   comprehensibility
        -   each module is isolated and therefore better to understand
    -   flexibility
