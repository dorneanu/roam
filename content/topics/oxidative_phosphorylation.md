-   cells take high-energy electrons and release their energy in a controlled manner
-   the body passes electrons to oxygen
-   but oxygen is impatient and wants the high-energy electrons
-   ca. 1-2% of the high-energy electrons are grabbed by oxygen
-   oxygen turns into hulk: superoxid type of free radical
-   superoxid is out of control, smashes around the cell, is damaging the :
-   this process is also called **oxidative stress**
