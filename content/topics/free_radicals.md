> Free radicals are molecules generated by the breakdown of oxygen during

> defense mechanism is able to neutralize the molecules with [antioxidants]({{< relref "antioxidants.md" >}}) such as
> glutathione, ubiquinone, flavonoids, and vitamins A, E, and C. But when our
> antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed by too many free radicals, cells can be
> damaged and our health adversely affected. This is what is known as oxidative
