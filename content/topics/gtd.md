### Chose items to engage with {#chose-items-to-engage-with}


## Lists {#lists}

-   Clarify what "things" mean to you before getting organized
-   Basic categories
    -   Projects list
    -   Project support material
    -   Reference material
    -   Calendar actions/information
    -   Next actions list
    -   Waiting for list
    -   Someday/maybe list

-   Also use a folder for read/review items (documents, bills, articles to read etc.)
-   Don't use support materials as reminders


## Buckets {#buckets}

**- \*Basic categories**

-   Projects list
-   Project support material
-   Reference material
-   Calendar actions/information
-   Next actions list
-   Waiting for list
-   Someday/maybe list

<!--listend-->

## Emtpyting the in-tray {#emtpyting-the-in-tray}

-   Processing guidelines
    -   Process top item first
        -   Don't do emergency scanning
            -   Everything has the same priority
            -   Process "things" in the same order they come "in"
    -   Process one item at a time
        -   Don't process stack of "things"
    -   Never put anything back into "in"
        -   There is a one-way path out of "in"
        -   Actionable items
            -   Have clear "physical" and "visible" next steps
            -   Determine what physical activity needs to happen to get you to decide
            -   Follow the 2-min rule
                -   But this doesn't work with creative tasks or (software) engineering ones because it can take more time to finish them
-   Goal is to get at the bottom of the tray


## 3 priority frameworks {#3-priority-frameworks}

... in the context of deciding actions

-   The 4-criteria model for choosing actions in the moment
    -   You make actions based on
        -   Context
        -   Time available
        -   Energy available
        -   Priority
-   The 3-fold model for evaluating daily work
    -   Don't do urgent tasks
    -   There are no interruptions, there are mismanaged occurrences
-   GTD/The 6-level model for reviewing your own work
    -   Like the floors of a building
        -   Horizon 5: life
        -   Horizon 4: long-term visions
        -   Horizon 3: one to two-years goals
        -   Horizon 2: areas of focus and accountability
            -   Current job responsibilities
            -   Areas of my life to maintain at an appropriate standard
        -   Horizon 1: current projects
            -   Finalize your projects list
        -   Ground: current actions
            -   Have your [lists](#lists) up-to-date
        -   Handle what has your [attention](#managing-attention) (bottom-up approach)


## 5 phases of project planning {#5-phases-of-project-planning}


### Key ingredients {#key-ingredients}

-   Horizontal focus
    -   Clearly define outcomes (projects)
    -   Next actions required to move toward closure
    -   Reminders reviewed regularly
-   Vertical focus
    -   Do more informal planning
    -   Also called "back of the envelope" planning
    -   Formal/structured meetings skip critical issues like why the project is done in the first place
        -   It doesn't allow creative Brainstorming


### The natural planning model {#the-natural-planning-model}

-   Basic idea
    -   Imagine the outcome
    -   Generate ideas that might be relevant
    -   Sort them into a structure
    -   Define physical activity that would begin to make it a reality
-   Tool: your brain
-   Mind goes through 5 steps
    -   1) Define purpose and principles
        -   Always ask the
        -   What's the purpose of the task/project

            -   Clarifies focus
            -   Expands options
    -   2) Outcome visioning
        -   This is the what instead of why
        -   Power of focus
            -   The focus we hold in mind affects perception and handling
    -   3) Brainstorming
    -   4) Organizing
        -   Key steps
            -   Identify significant piecea
            -   Sort by
                -   Components
                -   Sequences
                -   Detail to required degree
    -   5) Identify next actions
