    -   Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems in software engineering. Rather thanÂ a comprehensive solution, a design pattern is a description of a problem and a template of how to solve it. This template then becomes usable in many different contexts.
-   Idea:
    -   study the problem and the solutions
    -   goal is to identify patterns among your requirements and architecture
    -   use pre-conceived solutions to the problem
    -   if design is composed of well-known patterns, it's easy to:
        -   share idea
        -   communicate and discuss with other stakeholders
