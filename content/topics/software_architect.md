-   Role
    -   define a blueprint for what needs to be built
    -   ensure the team has enough details to get the job done
    -   guides the rest of the team toward this design during execution
    -   talks to stakeholders
    -   it's possible to do the architect's job w/o coding:

        -   one must understand the low-level details, constraints and complexity

    -   create a shape for the system that recognizes policy as the most essential element while making the details irrelevant
        -   this also allows decisions about the details to be delayed and deferred
    -   takes late decisions and shapes the [Software System]({{< relref "software_system.md" >}}) in a way that decisions can still be deferred or changed for as long as possible
        -   also maximizes number of decisions not made
