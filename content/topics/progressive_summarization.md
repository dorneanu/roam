## Different Layers of Highlighting {#different-layers-of-highlighting}

-   Layer 1: When you encounter something interesting, capture it
-   Layer 2: Bold the most interesting parts
-   Layer 3: Highlight the most interesting bolded sections
-   Layer 4: Summarize the bolded portions and the note in your own words
-   Layer 5: Turn your notes into something new: a tweet, a blog post, even a book

Each layer should include **no more than 10-20% of the previous layer**.

    > There are some highly desirable **characteristics** of progressive summarization:
    >
    > -   **just in time vs ahead of time**: you only do the work when you need to
    > -   **incremental work**: you only do minimal work at each layer which can then be leveraged in later layers
    > -   **active vs passive**: you actively read the text instead of skimming it
