## Different Layers of Highlighting {#different-layers-of-highlighting}

-   Layer 1: When you encounter something interesting, capture it
-   Layer 2: Bold the most interesting parts
-   Layer 3: Highlight the most interesting bolded sections
-   Layer 4: Summarize the bolded portions and the note in your own words
-   Layer 5: Turn your notes into something new: a tweet, a blog post, even a book

Each layer should include **no more than 10-20% of the previous layer**.
