-   Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms in a safe and efficient manner and decouple clients from implementation specifics. With these patterns, the code using an object need not know details about how the object is created, or even the specific type of jobject, as long as the object adheres to the interface expected.

-   Factory method

-   Builder

-   Abstract factory

-   Singleton
