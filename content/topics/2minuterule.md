-   when you start a new habit it should take less than 2 minutes to do

    -   _ritualize_ the beginning of a practice

    > Even when you know you should start small, it's easy to start too big. When
    > you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end
    > up trying to do too much too soon.
