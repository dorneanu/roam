    Happiness comes from within: <span class="underline">self-conained binaries</span>

    Go is <span class="underline">verb-oriented</span>. Put a pot on the stove. Boil water. Pour the water over some tea leaves. Wait. Drink. This is the way humans think. When planning a task, you think about the necessary actions before you think about the array of objects needed for executing these actions.

Go's “\*do something\*” approach gets your **stuff done.**

The `net/http` package allows building a basic **HTTP server** with a **few lines of code**.

Go has quite a unique approach of **abstracting away data sources and sinks as uniform data streams**. An `io.Reader` stream, for example, can represent input from a file, a network connection, an in-memory buffer, or even a simple string. Unit-test your code with a byte buffer, then use it in production with real files.
