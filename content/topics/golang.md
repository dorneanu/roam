    > Happiness comes from within: <span class="underline">self-conained binaries</span>
    >
    > Go is <span class="underline">verb-oriented</span>. Put a pot on the stove. Boil water. Pour the water over some tea leaves. Wait. Drink. This is the way humans think. When planning a task, you think about the necessary actions before you think about the array of objects needed for executing these actions.
    >
    > Go's “\*do something\*” approach gets your **stuff done.**
    >
    > The `net/http` package allows building a basic **HTTP server** with a **few lines of code**.
    >
    > Go has quite a unique approach of **abstracting away data sources and sinks as uniform data streams**. An `io.Reader` stream, for example, can represent input from a file, a network connection, an in-memory buffer, or even a simple string. Unit-test your code with a byte buffer, then use it in production with real files.

-   2024-03-01 ◦ [Let's Go](https://alexedwards.gumroad.com/l/lets-go)

    > Let's Go teaches you step-by-step how to create fast, secure and maintainable web applications using the fantastic programming language Go.
    >
    > The idea behind the book is to help you learn by doing. Together we'll walk through the start-to-finish build of a complete web application — from structuring your workspace, through to session management, authenticating users, securing your server and testing your application.
    >
    > Building a complete web application has a number of benefits: it helps put the things you're learning into context, demonstrates how different parts of your codebase link together, and forces us to work through the edge-cases and difficulties that come up when writing software in real-life. In essence, you'll learn more that you would by just reading Go's (great) documentation or standalone blog posts.
    >
    > Although you can read the book cover-to-cover, it's designed specifically for you to follow along and build the application yourself.
    > Break out your text editor, and happy coding!
