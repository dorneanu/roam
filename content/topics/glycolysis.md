Glycolysis is the metabolic process that converts [glucose]({{< relref "glukose.md" >}}) into pyruvate,
producing ATP and NADH in the process. It is the first stage in cellular
respiration and occurs in the cytoplasm of all living cells. Glycolysis involves
a series of enzymatic reactions that **break down glucose into two molecules of
pyruvate**. The energy released during glycolysis is used to produce [ATP]({{< relref "atp.md" >}}), which is
the primary source of energy for cellular processes. Glycolysis does not require
oxygen, making it an anaerobic process, but it is a precursor to aerobic
respiration, which does require oxygen.
