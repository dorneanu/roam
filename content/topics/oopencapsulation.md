-   provides an easy way to distinguish between data and function
    -   example: private data members vs public member functions of a class
-   Encapsulation is the key guiding principle for class design. It implies exposing a contract for the behavior of objects and hiding volatile implementation details. The private attributes and methods are hidden inside a capsule according to a need-to-know basis

> Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is
> the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a
> different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from
> being accessed by the code outside this shield. -- [Encapsulation in Golang](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-golang/)
