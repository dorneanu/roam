-   located at the base of the brain stem
-   monitor changes of [Carbon Dioxide]({{< relref "carbon_dioxide.md" >}}) levels and send alarm signals to the brain, telling the lungs to breathe faster and more deeply
-   when we're breathing too quickly, the receptors tell the body to breathe more slowly to increase [Carbon Dioxide]({{< relref "carbon_dioxide.md" >}}) levels
-   **Chemoreception** is one the most fundamental functions of life
    -   first aerobic life forms had to sense carbon dioxide to avoid it
    -   as humans evolved chemoreception became more plastic
        -   humans could adapt to changing environments
        -   it it the ability to adapt to different levels of [Carbon Dioxide]({{< relref "carbon_dioxide.md" >}}) and oxygen that helped humans colonize at different (and high) altitudes
