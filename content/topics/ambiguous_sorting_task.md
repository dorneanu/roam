-   You have 25 cards
    -   each one describes a real world phenomenon
        -   how the Internet works
        -   what are economic bubbles
    -   each card falls into 2 categories
        -   its domain (economy, IT etc.)
        -   its deep structure
-   The problem is that most people are not able to put the cards into the categories based on causality
-   Only if you have a _range_ (broad) of domain knowledge, you'll be able to find good _deep structures_
-   This ability [Analogical thinking]({{< relref "analogical_thinking.md" >}}) helps with categorizing the type of problem being faced
    -   the best problem solvers begin with the typing of the problem
