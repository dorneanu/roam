-   **adenosine triphosphate**
-   delivers energy for different biological processes including muscle contraction
-   exists in cells that are in an _anaerobic_ state ([Anaerobic respiration]({{< relref "anaerobic_respiration.md" >}})) (w/o presence of oxygen)
    -   but they multiply exponentially in cells in _aerobic_ state (with presence of oxygen)
-   _aerobic dissimilation_ influences mitochondrial process and 30 x more ATP molecules are created when there is no oxygen
-   by applying [The Wim Hof Method]({{< relref "../books/the_wim_hof_method.md" >}}) you can increase the amount of ATP in your cells
