## Engineering principles {#engineering-principles}

-   High-level design

    > This is the decomposition of the system into high-level components. This serves as the blueprint that the product and code need to follow at every stage of the product development life cycle. For example, once we have a layered architecture (see the following section), then we can easily identify for any new requirement to which layer each new component should

-   Quality attributes

    > We want high quality code, and this means no code checking would be allowed without unit tests and 90% code coverage

-   Product velocity

    > The product has a bounded value in time and, to ensure that there is high developer productivity, the team should build Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CICD) pipelines from the start.

-   A/B testing

    > Every feature should have a flag, so that it can be shown only to an x percentage of users


## Other requirements {#other-requirements}

-   To fulfill its purpose, software must be soft---that is, it must be easy to change. When the stakeholders change their minds about a feature, that change should be simple and easy to make
