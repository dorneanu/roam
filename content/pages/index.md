Welcome, bine ai venit, willkommen! My name is [Victor Dorneanu](https://dornea.nu) and this is the place where I store my so called **external brain**. This project is aimed at collecting almost everything I know or try to remember. What you see right now is basically my **personal knowledge base** built with [org-roam]({{< relref "topics/org_roam.md" >}}).

Although I still haven't figured out how to perfectly structure my notes, quotes and these are some areas you can read about:

-   üß∞ Coding
    -   At the moment I mainly develop in [Golang]({{< relref "topics/golang.md" >}}) and [Python]({{< relref "topics/python.md" >}})
    -   I like to run my code in a [Serverless]({{< relref "topics/serverless.md" >}}) environment
    -   I like solutions which scale up especially in an [AWS]({{< relref "topics/aws.md" >}}) context
    -   You can check my code at [github.com/dorneanu](https://github.com/dorneanu) or [gitlab.com/vdorneanu](https://gitlab.com/vdorneanu)
-   üîí [Security]({{< relref "topics/security.md" >}})
