-   2023-09-20 â—¦ [Ep. 255: The Failure Of Cybernetic Productivity - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udzf5F1GPME&ab_channel=CalNewport)

    Cybernetic Productivity Principles:
    dominated since the early 2000s

    1.  **Automate and speed up shallow task as much as possible**
        -   Have this software tool speak to this software tool, send data from your
            browser to your Exceel sheet or to your editor (and vice versa)
        -   use as less clicks as possible
        -   automate all the things
    2.  **Try to keep needed information at your finger tips**
        -   make it easy to organize and get access to information
        -   the more we have the right information when we need it, the more
            effective knowledge workers we are going to be
        -   Google: You can search for all types of information
        -   In general Knowlegde Management tools implement this principle that
            information should never be to far from the person who needs it
    3.  **Remove friction from communication**
        -   communication has to be easy
        -   if friction is removed, high velocity communication/colaboration can be achieved
    4.  **Simplify the extraction of actionable wisdom from data**
        -   the information we need to do things is often hidden in data
        -   we need tools that can find trends
        -   we need tools that can extract wisdom from data so we can have it at our
            finger tips

    This does not work because of the **infinite buffer** which is a sort of inbox that never ends.

    -   for knowledge workers the supply of work is infinite
    -   potential tasks are stored at individuals
        -   you push things towards people until they're ready to work on that task
        -   the buffer of work is growing so you always have more work to do
    -   combined with cybernetic productivity it has following effects:

        -   it speeds the shallow tasks (overhead work surrounding deeper work)
            -   that frees up time (for more work to fill the buffer)

        > We're jumping from project to project, google is findin this information or
        > maybe if we're more advanced chatGPT is grabbing the information for us that
        > we're automatically sending it over between different types of tools and
        > this data automatically goes over there and it's the cloud and it syncs.
        > We're moving faster, faster and faster and more work comes in to fill that
        > void and there is no time left to do the important stuff all those overheads
        > are trying to support in the first place.
        >
        > So we feel tired, we feel exhausted, the context switches are making us
        > dumber and we're spending less time actually doing the underlying work that
        > creates value, the actual work that is valued in the marketplace.
