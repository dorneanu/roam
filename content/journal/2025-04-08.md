## Podcast on Clean Architecture {#podcast-on-clean-architecture}

Today I was listening to
<https://threedots.tech/episode/is-clean-architecture-overengineering/> where the authors
were discussing the pros &amp; cons of "Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture / Ports &amp;
Adapters". The summarization (through notebook LLM):

> While the sources primarily discuss Clean Architecture, they note that Hexagonal
> Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) shares a similar core idea of separating
> domain from infrastructure. Therefore, the benefits attributed to Clean Architecture in
> the sources can also be considered benefits of Hexagonal Architecture. Here are the
> highlighted benefits:
>
> -   **Separation of concerns**: Clean Architecture, and by extension Hexagonal Architecture,
>     aims to separate the "interesting code" (domain logic) from the "boring code"
>     (implementation details like databases or external APIs). This separation makes the
>     codebase easier to understand and maintain.
> -   **Improved maintainability**: By isolating the domain logic, changes to infrastructure or
>     external dependencies are less likely to impact the core business rules, leading to more
>     maintainable code.
> -   **Easier testing**: The separation of concerns facilitates testing. Domain logic can be
>     tested in isolation without relying on external systems, making tests faster and more
>     reliable. Implementation details can be tested separately through integration tests.
> -   **Flexibility and replaceability of dependencies**: The Dependency Inversion Principle, a
>     core concept in these architectures, allows for the use of interfaces to define
>     dependencies. This makes it easier to replace one implementation detail with another,
>     such as switching databases or external services.
> -   **Better organization for complex projects with larger teams**: Clean Architecture is
>     particularly beneficial for organizing work in complex projects that will grow over time
>     and involve larger teams. The layered structure and separation of concerns provide a
>     clear framework for collaboration.
> -   **Parallel development**: By agreeing on interfaces between layers, different team members
>     can work on separate parts of a feature concurrently, speeding up development time.
> -   **Reduced cognitive overload**: A well-structured architecture makes it easier to reason
>     about the codebase because the responsibilities of different parts of the application
>     are clearly defined.
> -   **Onboarding new team members**: The clear structure can make it easier for new developers
>     to understand the codebase and contribute more quickly.
> -   **Extensibility**: The architecture facilitates the addition of new features and
>     functionalities over time with a lower risk of introducing side effects.
> -   **Improved team communication**: A shared understanding of the architectural patterns
>     provides a common vocabulary for discussing design and implementation details.
> -   **Insulation of changes**: Modifications in one layer are less likely to affect other
>     layers, reducing the risk of unintended consequences.
> -   **Improved navigation**: The consistent structure makes it easier to locate specific parts
>     of the code, such as entry points or data access logic. However, the sources also
>     caution that it's easy to go too far with these architectures, leading to
>     overengineering, especially for small projects or teams. Understanding the "why" behind
>     the pattern is crucial to avoid unnecessary complexity. Starting simple and evolving the
>     architecture as needed is recommended.

How to do that in [Golang]({{< relref "../topics/golang.md" >}}):

> Drawing on the sources, the authors suggest a pragmatic approach to layering in Go
> projects, rather than a strict, fixed number of layers. They highlight that Clean
> Architecture, which shares core ideas with Hexagonal and Onion Architectures, typically
> involves three or four layers depending on the complexity of your application.
>
> The layers they commonly discuss are:
>
> -   **Adapters**: This layer handles external communication and includes things like databases,
>     API clients, and entry points to your application such as HTTP handlers, gRPC handlers,
>     message queues, and CLIs. The authors note this layer is usually quite "boring" and maps
>     your code onto external code.
> -   **Application/Use Cases/Controllers (or Entry Points/Ports/Interfaces)**: This layer
>     contains the logic or orchestration of your application. It defines HTTP handlers, gRPC
>     handlers, message handlers, and even CLI entry points. A key benefit of this layer is
>     that it allows you to have different entry points for the same underlying operation.
> -   **Domain**: This is an optional layer containing the pure business logic, free of any
>     database or adapter concerns. The authors suggest this layer is more useful for complex
>     domains and that it's often better to see in code than to just talk about.

The authors emphasize the following key points regarding layers in Go projects:

> -   **Start Simple and Evolve**: Don't force a complex architecture from the beginning if your
>     project doesn't need it yet. It's better to let the architecture evolve over time.
> -   **Focus on Separation of Concerns**: The core idea is to separate your "interesting code"
>     (domain logic) from the "boring code" (implementation details).
> -   **Inversion of Control**: Use interfaces to achieve inversion of control of dependencies.
> -   **Layers as Concepts, Not Just Directories**: The layers are more conceptual groupings of
>     code rather than strict directory structures, although they often manifest as such.
> -   **Be Cautious with Too Many Layers**: If you find yourself with more than four layers, be
>     very careful and question their necessity.
> -   **Consider Project Complexity**: Clean Architecture is most beneficial for complex projects
>     with larger teams. For smaller, simpler projects, it can be overengineering. Sometimes
>     even within the same project, different modules might have varying levels of domain
>     complexity and may not require all the layers.
> -   **Go-Specific Considerations**: Go's implicit interfaces are a valuable feature that aligns
>     well with Clean Architecture. You can define interfaces close to where they are used,
>     making implementation convenient. Be wary of the anti-pattern of using a single model
>     for everything; different layers might benefit from having their own distinct data
>     structures, especially in more complex domains.


## Good example of implementing Clean Architecture {#good-example-of-implementing-clean-architecture}

Also, I came across
<https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jr7vya/built_a_full_ecommerce_backend_in_go_using_grpc/>
which mentions <https://github.com/rasadov/EcommerceAPI>. Here is the discussion I had with
[Claude](https://claude.site/artifacts/b6e97383-df90-4df1-aab5-d7a04f9f41f0).
