    > ROP stands for Return-Oriented Programming. It is primarily used to defeat
    > DEP/NX/W^X (Data Execution Prevention/No Execute/Write xor Execute) mitigations
    > in processors. Different manufacturers have different names for this particular
    > feature, but the idea is to mark certain areas of memory (notably stack and
    > heap) as non-executable. This makes attempts to execute instructions from areas
    > marked as non-executable cause an exeception (SEGFAULT). This mitigates generic
    > buffer overflow attacks, which usually involve writing some shellcode into
    > memory (usually the stack) and overwriting the saved return pointer or some
    > other way to jump to the shellcode and execute it. Since the stack is marked as
    > non-executable, the shellcode is not executed and a SEGFAULT is raised
