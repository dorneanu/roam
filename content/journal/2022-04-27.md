-   [Ready for changes with hexagonal architecture](https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749)
    -   The idea of Hexagonal Architecture is to put inputs and outputs at the edges of our design. Business logic should not depend on whether we expose a REST or a API, and it should not depend on where we get data from --- a database, a microservice API exposed via gRPC or REST, or just a simple CSV file.
    -   Nice explanations of [Hexagonal Architecture]({{< relref "../topics/hexagonal_architecture.md" >}})
