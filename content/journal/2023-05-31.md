    > Later, psychologist **Keith Stanovich** applied the same insight to reading. Those
    > with a **slight advantage in early reading** ability had a slightly **reduced cost of
    > reading new material**. This lead to them practicing more, further reducing the
    > costs of reading. Given the connection between reading and other forms of
    > learning, he even hypothesized that **early reading ability might bootstrap
    > intelligence by making it easier to acquire new skills and knowledge**.

    > To summarize, many decisions about learning have the following features:
    >
    > – Doing it yourself doesn’t initially pass a cost-benefit test.
    >
    > – The more you practice, the lower the cost becomes.
    >
    > – Thus whether it’s “worth it” to learn something depends on a far-sighted
    >   calculation of how much you’ll need to use the skill.
