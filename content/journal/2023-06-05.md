    -   Some mitigations

        > -   Enable mandatory **2fa** within your Github organization (if you don't use an
        >
        > organization, you probably should)
        >
        > -   **Disable** the ability to fork repos in your organization
        >
        > -   Configure and enable mandatory SAML authentication. In combination with
        >
        > mandatory 2fa, this makes phishing and even key leakage less likely (specific
        > keys need to be double authorized for SAML, so that random private key you have
        > on a random CI/CD platform from a few years ago can't access repos in SAML
        > organizations even if it's leaked)
        >
        > -   Disable the ability to **make repos public at the organization level**
        >
        > These are some quick setting changes that should address at least 3 of the 4
        > main issues in the article.
        >
        > Additional suggestion:
        >
        > **Enable branch protection** on master. Require at least 1 peer review to merge
        > anything in it. Enforce branch restrictions to include repo admins so
        > restrictions can't be bypassed. This should stop obvious mistakes like
        > accidentally committing .git or random credentials.
