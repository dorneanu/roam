    > Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Stack Overflow - these
    > companies and others started out as monolithic code bases. Many have a
    > monolith at their core to this day. Stack Overflow makes it a point of pride
    > how little hardware they need to run the massive site. Shopify is still a
    > Rails monolith, leveraging the tried and true Resque to proces billions of
    > tasks.

    > WhatsApp went supernova with their Erlang monolith and 50 engineers. How?
    >
    > -   WhatsApp consciously keeps the engineering staff small to only about 50
    >     engineers.
    > -   Individual engineering teams are also small, consisting of 1 - 3 engineers
    >     and teams are each given a great deal of autonomy.
    > -   In terms of servers, WhatsApp prefers to use a smaller number of servers and
    >     vertically scale each server to the highest extent possible.
