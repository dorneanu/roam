    > One of the **AWS serverless design principles** is to <span class="underline">share nothing</span>, and
    > separating your microservices to individual repositories makes it easy to not
    > accidentally do something you shouldn't.
    >
    > Build <span class="underline">self-containing</span> services. Don't build stacks that require resources from other
    > services in order to deploy. However, you can (and should!) build microservices that
    > depend on others to satisfy business processes through loose coupling via API calls
    > or events.
    >
    > If you're looking to get started with [\*microservices]({{< relref "../topics/microservices.md" >}})\*, don't forget they are **driven by
    > domain**. When looking to "break up the monolith" start by identifying the discrete
    > pieces of your application. Find the **areas of the application that have enough
    > business logic** to be on their own and iterated separately from everything else.
