#### Note {#note}

> When people describe themselves as being stressed, they usually mean the nervous
> agitation they experience under excessive demands-most com- monly in the areas
> of work, family, relationships, finances or health. But sensations of nervous
> tension do not define stress-nor, strictly speaking, are they always perceived
> when people are stressed. Stress, as we will define it, is not a matter of
> subjective feeling. It is a measurable set of objective physiological events in
> the body, involving the brain, the hormonal appa- ratus, the immune system and
> many other organs. Both animals and peo- ple can experience stress with no
> awareness of its presence.


#### Definition of stress {#definition-of-stress}

> What, then, is stress? Selye-who coined the word in its presen usage and who
> described with mock pride how der stress, le stress and l stress entered the
> German, French and Italian languages respectively- conceived of stress as a
> biological process, a wide-ranging set of event in the body, irrespective of
> cause or of subjective awareness. Stress con- sists of the internal
> alterations-visible or not that occur when the organism perceives a threat to
> its existence or well-being. While nerwartension may be a component of stress,
> one can be stressed without feel- ing tension. On the other hand, it is possible
> to feel tension without activating the physiological mechanisms of stress.

> In searching for a word to capture the meaning of the physical changes he
> observed in his experiments, Selye "stumbled upon the term stress, which had
> long been used in common English, and particularly in engineering, to denote the
> effects of a force acting against a resistance." He gives the example of changes
> induced in a stretched rubber band or in a steel spring under pressure. These
> changes may be noted with the naked eye or may be evident only on microscopic
> examination.

<!--quoteend-->

> Selye's analogies illustrate an important point: excessive stress occurs when
> the demands made on an organism exceed that organism's rea- sonable capacities
> to fulfill them. The rubber band snaps, the spring becomes deformed. The stress
> response can be set off by physical dam- age, either by infection or injury. It
> can also be triggered by emotional trauma or just by the threat of such trauma,
> even if purely imaginary. Physiological stress responses can be evoked when the
> threat is outside conscious awareness or even when the individual may believe
> himself to be stressed in a "good" way.
