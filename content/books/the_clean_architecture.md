## Quotes {#quotes}


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 1 {#the-clean-architecture-note-1}

> Not only does a good architecture meet the needs of its users, developers, and
> owners at a given point in time, but it also meets them over time


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 2 {#the-clean-architecture-note-2}

> You think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture. —Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 3 {#the-clean-architecture-note-3}

> Architecture is a hypothesis, that needs to be proven by implementation and
> measurement. —Tom Gilb


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 4 {#the-clean-architecture-note-4}

> When software is done right, it requires a fraction of the human resources to
> create and maintain. Changes are simple and rapid. Defects are few and far
> between. Effort is minimized, and functionality and flexibility are maximized.


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 5 {#the-clean-architecture-note-5}

> The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 6 {#the-clean-architecture-note-6}

> If you give me a program that works perfectly but is impossible to change, then
> it won’t work when the requirements change, and I won’t be able to make it work.
> Therefore the program will become useless. If you give me a program that does
> not work but is easy to change, then I can make it work, and keep it working as
> requirements change. Therefore the program will remain continually useful.


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 7 {#the-clean-architecture-note-7}

> Software—the stuff of computer programs—is composed of sequence, selection,
> iteration, and indirection. Nothing more. Nothing less.


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 8 {#the-clean-architecture-note-8}

> First of all, a software architect is a programmer; and continues to be a
> programmer. Never fall for the lie that suggests that software architects pull
> back from code to focus on higher-level issues. They do not! Software architects
> are the best programmers, and they continue to take programming tasks, while
> they also guide the rest of the team toward a design that maximizes
> productivity. Software architects may not write as much code as other
> programmers do, but they continue to engage in programming tasks.


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 9 {#the-clean-architecture-note-9}

> The architecture of a software system is the shape given to that system by those
> who build it. The form of that shape is in the division of that system into
> components, the arrangement of those components, and the ways in which those
> components communicate with each other.


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 10 {#the-clean-architecture-note-10}

> Think of Main as the dirtiest of all the dirty components


#### The Clean Architecture - Note 11 {#the-clean-architecture-note-11}

> At first we thought all the computer power would be in server farms, and the
> browsers would be stupid. Then we started putting applets in the browsers. But
> we didn’t like that, so we moved dynamic content back to the servers. But then
> we didn’t like that, so we invented Web 2.0 and moved lots of processing back
> into the browser with Ajax and JavaScript. We went so far as to create whole
> huge applications written to execute in the browsers. And now we’re all excited
> about pulling that JavaScript back into the server with Node.
