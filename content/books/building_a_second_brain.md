## Raw Notes {#raw-notes}

The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future selfVII—by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—leave it better than you found it. This ensures that the notes you interact with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous cycle

This fundamental tension—between quality and quantity—is a tension we share as knowledge workers. We also must produce work to an extremely high standard, and we must do it fast, continuously, all year long. We are like sprinters who are also trying to run a marathon.
Chefs have a particular system for accomplishing this daunting feat. It’s called mise en place, a culinary philosophy used in restaurants around the world. Developed in France starting in the late 1800s, mise en place is a step-by-step process for producing high-quality food efficiently. Chefs can never afford to stop the whole kitchen just so they can clean up. They learn to keep their workspace clean and organized in the flow of the meals they are preparing.
In the kitchen, this means small habits like always putting the mixing spoon in the same place so they know where to find it next time; immediately wiping a knife clean after using it so it’s ready for the next cut; or laying out the ingredients in the order they’ll be used so that they serve as placeholders

---

Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it’s just a theory.

---

---

Think of yourself not just as a taker of notes, but as a giver of notes—you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand

---

---

If we consider the focused application of our attention to be our greatest asset as knowledge workers, we can no longer afford to let that intermediate work disappear. If we consider how precious little time we have to produce something extraordinary in our careers, it becomes imperative that we recycle that knowledge back into a system where it can become useful again.

---

This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down:
In which project will this be most useful?
If none: In which area will this be most useful?
If none: Which resource does this belong to?
If none: Place in archives.

. The Hemingway Bridge: Use Yesterday’s Momentum Today

---

We’ve been taught that it’s important to work “with the end in mind.” We are told that it is our responsibility to deliver results, whether that is a finished product on store shelves, a speech delivered at an event, or a published technical document.
This is generally good advice, but there is a flaw in focusing only on the final results: all the intermediate work—the notes, the drafts, the outlines, the feedback—tends to be underappreciated and undervalued

---

The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself visiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones of my thinking. Looking only at the points I’ve previously bolded and highlighted in layers two and three makes it far easier to write this summary than if I was trying to summarize the entire article all at once

---

Popularized in a previous period of information overload, the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the commonplace book was more than a diary or journal of personal reflections. It was a learning tool that the educated class used to understand a rapidly changing world and their place in

The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?

---

Instead of confronting a terrifying blank page, I’m looking at a document filled with quotes: from letters, from primary sources, from scholarly papers, sometimes even my own notes. It’s a great technique for warding off the siren song of procrastination. Before I hit on this approach, I used to lose weeks stalling before each new chapter, because it was just a big empty sea of nothingness. Now each chapter starts life as a kind of archipelago of inspiring quotes, which makes it seem far less daunting. All I have to do is build bridges between the islands

---

Here’s what most people miss: it’s not enough to simply divide tasks into smaller pieces—you then need a system for managing those pieces. Otherwise, you’re just creating a lot of extra work for yourself trying to keep track of them

---

There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us:
Making our ideas concrete.
Revealing new associations between ideas.
Incubating our ideas over time.
Sharpening our unique perspectives.

---

Those four retrieval methods are:
Search
Browsing
Tags
Serendipity

As people set out on their Second Brain journey, there are three stages of progress I often observe—and even encourage. Those stages are remembering, connecting, and creating

---

I eventually named this organizing system PARA,I which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from any source, in any format, for any purpose.II

---

helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10–20 percent of the previous layer. If you save a series of excerpts from a book amounting to five hundred words, the bolded second layer should include no more than one hundred words, and highlighted third layer no more than twenty. This isn’t an exact science, but if you find yourself highlighting everything, this rule should give you pause

---

Essence

---

Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate

---

In this sense, notetaking is like time travel—you are sending packets of knowledge through time to your future self.
You

What is the point of knowledge if it doesn’t help anyone or produce anything?IV Whether your goal is to lose weight, get a promotion at work, start a side business, or strengthen your local community, personal knowledge management exists to support taking action—anything else is a distraction.
A common challenge for

---

The third category of information that we want to keep is resources. This is basically a catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area and could include any topic you’re interested in gathering information about.
For example:
What topics are you interested in? Architecture; Interior design; English literature; Beer brewing.
What subjects are you researching? Habit formation; Notetaking; Project management; Nutrition.
What useful information do you want to be able to reference? Vacation itineraries; Life goals; Stock photos; Product testimonials.
Which hobbies or passions do

This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.V We all naturally have a desire to create—to bring to life something good, true, or beautiful.9 It’s a part of our essential nature. Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others—by inspiring, entertaining, or educating them

How do you create a Hemingway Bridge? Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:
Write down ideas for next steps: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one.
Write down the current status: This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect.
Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away: Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you’re designing.
Write out your intention for the next work session: Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach

“CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express

---

Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend organizing them according to where they are going—specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize

---

The most common question I hear about Progressive Summarization is “When should I be doing this highlighting?” The answer is that you should do it when you’re getting ready to create something

---

PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. It’s no use trying to find the “perfect place” where a note or file belongs. There isn’t one. The whole system is constantly shifting and changing in sync with your constantly changing life.

---

Capture: Keep What Resonates

---

This is why it’s so important to take on a Curator’s Perspective—that we are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives. Thinking like a curator means taking charge of your own information stream, instead of just letting it wash over you. The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.II
Here are four criteria I suggest to help you decide exactly which nuggets of knowledge are worth keeping

---

If you want to write a book, you could dial down the scope and write a series of online articles outlining your main ideas. If you don’t have time for that, you could dial it down even further and start with a social media post explaining the essence of your message

---

When you make your digital notes a working environment, not just a storage environment, you end up spending a lot more time there. When you spend more time there, you’ll inevitably notice many more small opportunities for change than you expect. Over time, this will gradually produce an environment far more suited to your real needs than anything you could have planned up front. Just like professional chefs keep their environment organized with small nudges and adjustments, you can use noticing habits to “organize as you go.”

I call it “Twelve Favorite Problems,” inspired by Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman

---

External knowledge could include:
Highlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read.
Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.
Bookmarks and favorites: Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts.
Voice memos: Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”
Meeting notes: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls.
Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.
Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended

---

This tendency is known as recency bias.4 We tend to favor the ideas, solutions, and influences that occurred to us most recently, regardless of whether they are the best ones. Now imagine if you were able to unshackle yourself from the limits of the present moment, and draw on weeks, months, or even years of accumulated imagination

---

Any one of these subjects could become its own resource folder. You can also think of them as “research” or “reference materials.” They are trends you are keeping track of, ideas related to your job or industry, hobbies and side interests, and things you’re merely curious about. These folders are like the class notebooks you probably kept in school: one for biology, another for history, another for math

---

Don’t save entire chapters of a book—save only select passages. Don’t save complete transcripts of interviews—save a few of the best quotes. Don’t save entire websites—save a few screenshots of the sections that are most interesting. The best curators are picky about what they allow into their collections, and you should be too. With a notes app, you can always save links back to the original content if you need to review your sources or want to dive deeper into the details in the future.
The biggest

Express: Show Your Work

---

First, you are much more likely to remember information you’ve written down in your own words. Known as the “Generation Effect,”10 researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words. Writing things down is a way of “rehearsing” those ideas, like practicing a dance routine or shooting hoops, which makes them far more likely to stick.

---

You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition

---

More than half the workforce today can be considered “knowledge workers”—professionals for whom knowledge is their most valuable asset, and who spend a majority of their time managing large amounts of information

---

---

Everything in a kitchen is designed and organized to support an outcome—preparing a meal as efficiently as possible. The archives are like the freezer—items are in cold storage until they are needed, which could be far into the future. Resources are like the pantry—available for use in any meal you make, but neatly tucked away out of sight in the meantime. Areas are like the fridge—items that you plan on using relatively soon, and that you want to check on more frequently. Projects are like the pots and pans cooking on the stove—the items you are actively preparing right now. Each kind of food is organized according to how accessible it needs to be for you to make the meals you want to eat

---

Notetaking gives you a way to deliberately practice the skill of distilling every day

---

“Hemingway Bridge.” He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear. This meant that the next time he sat down to work on his story, he knew exactly where to start. He built himself a bridge to the next day, using today’s energy and momentum to fuel tomorrow’s writing.IV

This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household.

Organize: Save for Actionability

---

These are clearly identifiable, discrete chunks of work. This project-centric approach is increasingly finding its way into all knowledge work, a trend named the “Hollywood model” after the way films are made

---

The practice of keeping personal notes also arose in other countries, such as biji in China (roughly translated as “notebook”), which could contain anecdotes, quotations, random musings, literary criticism, short fictional stories, and anything else that a person thought worth recording. In Japan, zuihitsu (known as “pillow books”) were collections of notebooks used to document a person’s life.

1.  Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something Small and Concrete

---

I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words

---

This is why it’s so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: “keeping what resonates” in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term. Most notes apps have an “inbox” or “daily notes” section where new notes you’ve captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide where they belong. Think of it as a waiting area where new ideas live until you are ready to digest them into your Second Brain. Separating the capturing and organizing of ideas helps you stay present, notice what resonates, and leave the decision of what to do with them to a separate time (such as a “weekly review,” which I will cover in Chapter 9).
Once you’ve captured

---

You have to always assume that, until proven otherwise, any given note won’t necessarily ever be useful. You have no idea what your future self will need, want, or be working on. This assumption forces you to be conservative in the time you spend summarizing notes, doing so only when it’s virtually guaranteed that it will be worth it

## Quotes {#quotes}


### Struggling with information {#struggling-with-information}

> Everyone is in desperate need of a system to manage the ever-increasing volume of
> information pouring into their brains. I’ve heard the plea from students and executives,
> entrepreneurs and managers, engineers and writers, and so many others seeking a more
> productive and empowered relationship with the information they consume


## Archipelago of Ideas {#archipelago-of-ideas}

-   when creating new content (especially when writing) don't start with a blank page
-   gather a group of ideas, sources or main points that will form the very first structure of your content (essay, blog post, presentation, deliverable)
-   once a critical mass is reached, you switch into **convergence mode** (from **divergence mode**) and link your notes in a way that makes sense

> An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty
> performing at the same time: choosing ideas (known as selection) and arranging them into a
> logical flow (known as sequencing)

<!--quoteend-->

> An **archipelago** is a chain of islands in the ocean, usually formed by volcanic activity
> over long spans of time. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, are an archipelago of eight
> major islands


## CODE {#code}


### Intermediate Packets {#intermediate-packets}

The power of **thinking small**. These are the _intermediate_ steps that will help you to actually finish your project. These can be _reusable_ so you can use them for different projects. These are basically the **next actionable steps** in [GTD]({{< relref "../../topics/gtd.md" >}})

There are 5 types:

-   **distilled notes**
    -   distilled content (from books, articles) you can easily understand and use (after using [Progressive Summarization]({{< relref "../../topics/progressive_summarization.md" >}}))
-   **outtakes**
    -   material you didn't use in one project but that might be useful in another
-   **work-in-progress**
    -   documents, presentations, graphics, diagrams, plans produced during _past_ projects
-   **finale deliverables**
    -   _concrete_ pieces of work delivered within past projects which could become part of something new
-   **documents created by others**
    -   content/assets created by others (people on your team, clients, contractors, consultants) that can be referenced
        and used in your projects


### Capture {#capture}


#### Notes {#notes}

Characteristics every digital notes app **should** have:

-   **Multimedia**

    > Just like a paper notebook might contain drawings and sketches, quotes and ideas, and
    > even a pasted photo or Post-it, a notes app can store a <span class="underline">wide variety of different kinds
    > of content</span> in one place, so you never need to wonder where to put something.
-   **Informal**

    > Notes are inherently messy, so there’s no need for perfect spelling or polished
    > presentation. This makes it as <span class="underline">easy</span> and <span class="underline">frictionless</span> as possible to jot things down as
    > soon as they occur to you, which is essential to allow nascent ideas to grow.
-   **Open-ended**

    > Taking notes is a <span class="underline">continuous process</span> that never really ends, and you don’t always know
    > where it might lead. Unlike more specialized kinds of software that are designed to
    > produce a specific kind of output (such as slide decks, spreadsheets, graphics, or
    > videos), notes are ideal for <span class="underline">free-form exploration</span> before you have a goal in mind.
-   **Action-oriented**

    > Unlike a library or research database, personal notes **don’t need to be comprehensive or
    > precise**. They are designed to help you <span class="underline">quickly capture</span> stray thoughts so you can remain
    > focused on the task at hand.


### Organize {#organize}


### Express {#express}


## Commonplace books {#commonplace-books}

> This practice continues among creatives today. Songwriters are known for compiling “hook
> books” full of lyrics and musical riffs they may want to use in future songs. Software
> engineers build “code libraries” so useful bits of code are easy to access. Lawyers keep
> “case files” with details from past cases they might want to refer to in the future.
> Marketers and advertisers maintain “swipe files” with examples of compelling ads they
> might want to draw from


## PARA {#para}

Every piece of information can be put into one of following categories:

-   **Projects**
    -   current tasks you're actually working on (short-term efforts)
-   **Areas**
    -   Reponsibilities you want to manage over time (long-term efforts)
-   **Resources**
    -   Topics/Interests that might be useful in the future
-   **Archives**
    -   _Inactive_ items from the categories above

Information is organized based on how _actionable_ it is and not on its _type_ or _kind_. That's why it's so universal
and applicable for almost every profession or field.


## Divergence vs Convergence {#divergence-vs-convergence}

If you look at the process of creating anything, it follows the same simple pattern, alternating back and forth between divergence and convergence.

---

The first two steps of CODE, Capture and Organize, make up divergence. They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing them in a secure place. This is where you research, explore, and add ideas. The final two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence. They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new
