## Raw Notes {#raw-notes}

Popularized in a previous period of information overload, the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the commonplace book was more than a diary or journal of personal reflections. It was a learning tool that the educated class used to understand a rapidly changing world and their place in

There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us:
Making our ideas concrete.
Revealing new associations between ideas.
Incubating our ideas over time.
Sharpening our unique perspectives.

Those four retrieval methods are:

What is the point of knowledge if it doesn’t help anyone or produce anything?IV Whether your goal is to lose weight, get a promotion at work, start a side business, or strengthen your local community, personal knowledge management exists to support taking action—anything else is a distraction.
A common challenge for

This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.V We all naturally have a desire to create—to bring to life something good, true, or beautiful.9 It’s a part of our essential nature. Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others—by inspiring, entertaining, or educating them

Any one of these subjects could become its own resource folder. You can also think of them as “research” or “reference materials.” They are trends you are keeping track of, ideas related to your job or industry, hobbies and side interests, and things you’re merely curious about. These folders are like the class notebooks you probably kept in school: one for biology, another for history, another for math

First, you are much more likely to remember information you’ve written down in your own words. Known as the “Generation Effect,”10 researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words. Writing things down is a way of “rehearsing” those ideas, like practicing a dance routine or shooting hoops, which makes them far more likely to stick.

Notetaking gives you a way to deliberately practice the skill of distilling every day

“Hemingway Bridge.” He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear. This meant that the next time he sat down to work on his story, he knew exactly where to start. He built himself a bridge to the next day, using today’s energy and momentum to fuel tomorrow’s writing.IV

This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household.

Organize: Save for Actionability

---

These are clearly identifiable, discrete chunks of work. This project-centric approach is increasingly finding its way into all knowledge work, a trend named the “Hollywood model” after the way films are made

---

The practice of keeping personal notes also arose in other countries, such as biji in China (roughly translated as “notebook”), which could contain anecdotes, quotations, random musings, literary criticism, short fictional stories, and anything else that a person thought worth recording. In Japan, zuihitsu (known as “pillow books”) were collections of notebooks used to document a person’s life.

1.  Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something Small and Concrete

---

I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words

---

This is why it’s so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: “keeping what resonates” in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term. Most notes apps have an “inbox” or “daily notes” section where new notes you’ve captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide where they belong. Think of it as a waiting area where new ideas live until you are ready to digest them into your Second Brain. Separating the capturing and organizing of ideas helps you stay present, notice what resonates, and leave the decision of what to do with them to a separate time (such as a “weekly review,” which I will cover in Chapter 9).
Once you’ve captured

---

You have to always assume that, until proven otherwise, any given note won’t necessarily ever be useful. You have no idea what your future self will need, want, or be working on. This assumption forces you to be conservative in the time you spend summarizing notes, doing so only when it’s virtually guaranteed that it will be worth it

## Quotes {#quotes}


### Struggling with information {#struggling-with-information}

> Everyone is in desperate need of a system to manage the ever-increasing volume of
> information pouring into their brains. I’ve heard the plea from students and executives,
> entrepreneurs and managers, engineers and writers, and so many others seeking a more
> productive and empowered relationship with the information they consume


### You are what you consume {#you-are-what-you-consume}

> You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition


### Notetaking and deliberate practice {#notetaking-and-deliberate-practice}

> Notetaking gives you a way to [deliberately practice]({{< relref "../../topics/deliberate_practice.md" >}}) the skill of distilling every day


## Archipelago of Ideas {#archipelago-of-ideas}

-   when creating new content (especially when writing) don't start with a blank page
-   gather a group of ideas, sources or main points that will form the very first structure of your content (essay, blog post, presentation, deliverable)
-   once a critical mass is reached, you switch into **convergence mode (from \*divergence mode**) and link your notes in a way that makes sense
    -   basically building bridges _between the islands_

> An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty
> performing at the same time: choosing ideas (known as selection) and arranging them into a
> logical flow (known as sequencing)

<!--quoteend-->

> An **archipelago** is a chain of islands in the ocean, usually formed by volcanic activity
> over long spans of time. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, are an archipelago of eight
> major islands


## Knowledge Work {#knowledge-work}

Knowledge workers are supposed to work at high standards, fast, continuously. This generates some tention between _quality_ and _quantity_. Culinary chefs have adopted a particular system for
dealing with these high-load working environments: [mise en place](#mise-en-place).

Knowledge is the most valuable asset for "knowledge workers" professionals. They spend a huge
amount of time _managing_ huge amount of information, _searching_ for the right piece of information.

On the importance of having a _working_ environment instead of just a _storage_ environment:

> When you make your [digital notes](#notes) a working environment, not just a storage environment, you end up spending a lot more time there. When you spend more time there, you’ll inevitably notice many more small opportunities for change than you expect. Over time, this will gradually produce an environment far more suited to your real needs than anything you could have planned up front. Just like professional chefs keep their [environment organized](#mise-en-place) with small nudges and adjustments, you can use noticing habits to “organize as you go.”


## Twelve Favorite Problems {#twelve-favorite-problems}

-   inspired by Richard Feynman

> “You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your
> mind,” Feynman told one interviewer. “Every time you hear or read a new trick or
> a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it
> helps.”

-   How can we make society fairer and more equitable?
-   How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?
-   How can I have closer relationships with the people I love?
-   How can I spend more of my time doing high-value work?
-   How do I live less in the past and more in the present?
-   How do I build an investment strategy that is aligned with my mid-term and long-term goals and commitments?
-   What does it look like to move from mindless consumption to mindful creation?
-   How can I go to bed early instead of watching shows after the kids go to bed?
-   How can my industry become more ecologically sustainable while remaining profitable?
-   How can I work through the fear I have of taking on more responsibility?
-   How can my school provide more resources for students with special needs?
-   How do I start reading all the books I already have instead of buying more?
-   How can I speed up and relax at the same time?
-   How can we make the healthcare system more responsive to people’s needs?
-   What can I do to make eating healthily easier?
-   How can I make decisions with more confidence?


## CODE {#code}


### Intermediate Packets {#intermediate-packets}

The power of **thinking small**. These are the _intermediate_ steps that will help you to actually finish your project. These can be _reusable_ so you can use them for different projects. These are basically the **next actionable steps** in [GTD]({{< relref "../../topics/gtd.md" >}})

There are 5 types:

-   **distilled notes**
    -   distilled content (from books, articles) you can easily understand and use (after using [Progressive Summarization]({{< relref "../../topics/progressive_summarization.md" >}}))
-   **outtakes**
    -   material you didn't use in one project but that might be useful in another
-   **work-in-progress**
    -   documents, presentations, graphics, diagrams, plans produced during _past_ projects
-   **finale deliverables**
    -   _concrete_ pieces of work delivered within past projects which could become part of something new
-   **documents created by others**
    -   content/assets created by others (people on your team, clients, contractors, consultants) that can be referenced
        and used in your projects

To work "with the end in mind" and always focus on the final results has some flaws. All the work you have done (till reaching the final end) are way underappreciated and undervalued.
That's why it's important to _recycle_ all the notes, drafts, outlines (in general: intermediate steps) into a system where it might become useful again (for other projects/ideas).

As you start your _Second Brain journey_ there are 3 stages of progress:

-   remembering
-   connecting
-   connecting


### Capture {#capture}

**Keep what resonates**


#### Notes {#notes}

Characteristics every digital notes app **should** have:

-   **Multimedia**

    > Just like a paper notebook might contain drawings and sketches, quotes and ideas, and
    > even a pasted photo or Post-it, a notes app can store a <span class="underline">wide variety of different kinds
    > of content</span> in one place, so you never need to wonder where to put something.
-   **Informal**

    > Notes are inherently messy, so there’s no need for perfect spelling or polished
    > presentation. This makes it as <span class="underline">easy</span> and <span class="underline">frictionless</span> as possible to jot things down as
    > soon as they occur to you, which is essential to allow nascent ideas to grow.
-   **Open-ended**

    > Taking notes is a <span class="underline">continuous process</span> that never really ends, and you don’t always know
    > where it might lead. Unlike more specialized kinds of software that are designed to
    > produce a specific kind of output (such as slide decks, spreadsheets, graphics, or
    > videos), notes are ideal for <span class="underline">free-form exploration</span> before you have a goal in mind.
-   **Action-oriented**

    > Unlike a library or research database, personal notes **don’t need to be comprehensive or
    > precise**. They are designed to help you <span class="underline">quickly capture</span> stray thoughts so you can remain
    > focused on the task at hand.

    Notes should be organized for action, according to the active _projects_ you're currently
    working on. Before putting a new now into your _second brain_ ask yourself how that particular information/note will help you move forward your project(s).


#### Where to put a note {#where-to-put-a-note}

If you don't know where to put a note, ask yourself these questions:

-   In which project will this be most useful?
-   If none: In which area will this be most useful?
-   If none: Which resource does this belong to?
-   If none: Place in archives.


#### Types of notes {#types-of-notes}

-   Highlights
    -   from books/articles
-   Quotes
    -   also from podcasts, audiobokos
-   Bookmarks and favorites
    -   links to interesting content
-   Voice memos
-   Meeting notes
-   Images
-   Takeaways
    -   lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended

Also be very _conservative_ when you want to save something to your external knowledge:

> Don’t save entire chapters of a book—save only select passages. Don’t save
> complete transcripts of interviews—save a few of the best quotes. Don’t save
> entire websites—save a few screenshots of the sections that are most
> interesting. The best curators are picky about what they allow into their
> collections, and you should be too. With a notes app, you can always save links
> back to the original content if you need to review your sources or want to dive
> deeper into the details in the future.


### Organize {#organize}

**Save for Actionability**


### Express {#express}

**Show your work**

-   **The Hemingway Bridge**
    -   Use Yesterday’s Momentum Today
    -   as you write leave some cognitive capacity and time to make notes what you'll write _tomorrow_
    -   the next day you can start immediately without having to think about where to start and what to write about

        > How do you create a Hemingway Bridge? Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:
        >
        > Write down **ideas** for **next steps**: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one.
        >
        > Write down the **current status**: This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect.
        >
        > Write down any **details** you **have in mind** that are **likely to be forgotten** once you step away: Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you’re designing.
        >
        > Write out your **intention** for the **next work session**: Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach


## Commonplace books {#commonplace-books}

> This practice continues among creatives today. Songwriters are known for compiling “hook
> books” full of lyrics and musical riffs they may want to use in future songs. Software
> engineers build “code libraries” so useful bits of code are easy to access. Lawyers keep
> “case files” with details from past cases they might want to refer to in the future.
> Marketers and advertisers maintain “swipe files” with examples of compelling ads they
> might want to draw from


## PARA {#para}

Information is organized based on how _actionable_ it is and not on its _type_ or _kind_. That's why it's so universal and applicable for almost every profession or field.

PARA is more like a _production_ system. You won't be able to always find the _right_ place
where a note belongs to. The category you initially put a note to, might change depending
on your current projects and however your thoughts change in _life_.

Every piece of information can be put into one of following categories:


### **Projects** {#projects}

-   current tasks you're actually working on (short-term efforts)


### **Areas** {#areas}

-   Reponsibilities you want to manage over time (long-term efforts)


### **Resources** {#resources}

-   Topics/Interests that might be useful in the future
-   What topics are you interested in?
    -   Architecture; Interior design; English literature; Beer brewing.
-   What subjects are you researching?
    -   Habit formation; Notetaking; Project management; Nutrition.
-   What useful information do you want to be able to reference?
    -   Vacation itineraries; Life goals; Stock photos; Product testimonials.
-   Hobbies
-   Passions


### **Archives** {#archives}

-   _Inactive_ items from the categories above


## Divergence vs Convergence {#divergence-vs-convergence}

When you create content you alternate back and forth between **divergence** and **convergence**.
As you capture (and organize) your information (the first 2 steps in [CODE](#code)) you "get off the track" and spread your focus horizontally. You do a lot of research, explore and add new ideas.
The last 2 steps in [CODE](#code) (_Distill_ and _Express_) are more about **convergence**. They force you to
straighten your focus, go more deep-dive and "shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new".


## Campsite rule {#campsite-rule}

Leave a place on a campsite better than you found it. This can be applied to information/notes as well. Everytime you touch a note, you should make it more _discoverable_ by adding more information to, put it in another place, adding a highlight etc.


## Mise en place {#mise-en-place}

-   A culinary philosophy used around the world
-   a step-by-step process for producing high-quality food
-   chefs have developed efficient habbits in order to
    -   keep the workspace clean
    -   and at the same time prepare other/next meals

> Everything in a kitchen is designed and organized to support an
> outcome—preparing a meal as efficiently as possible.
>
> The [archives](#archives) are like the freezer—items are in cold storage until they are needed, which could be far into the future.
>
> [Resources](#resources) are like the pantry—available for use in any meal you
> make, but neatly tucked away out of sight in the meantime.
>
> [Areas](#areas) are like the fridge—items that you plan on using relatively soon, and that you want to check on more frequently.
>
> [Projects](#projects) are like the pots and pans cooking on the stove—the
> items you are actively preparing right now. Each kind of food is organized
> according to how accessible it needs to be for you to make the meals you want to
> eat
