## Getting Things Done - The Art of Stress-Free Productivity {#getting-things-done-the-art-of-stress-free-productivity}

Although I'm using GTD for a couple of years now, I didn't have the time to read David Allen's "Gettings Things Done". Most of the diagrams and workflows you find online are scratching only at the surface of Allen's methodology.<br />
<br />

I'm pretty happy to have read the book entirely and extract additional concepts and tipps how to manage your life even better. For me it's definitely a strong book recommendation and I recommend it to everyone who has multiple projects to manage across different life areas. It's not only about some TODO, NEXT or DONE lists.It might take years to fully understand **and** adapt GTD to your own needs and your own life style.
