## Information as connection vs. representation {#information-as-connection-vs-dot-representation}

Information's primary function is to **create networks and connections** rather than merely
represent reality. This fundamental insight challenges traditional views of information as
truth-seeking.

Key quote (p. 35):

> What the example of astrology illustrates is that errors, lies, fantasies, and fictions
> are information, too. Contrary to what the **naive view** of information says, information has
> no essential link to truth, and its role in history isn't to represent a preexisting
> reality. Rather, **what information does is to create new realities by tying together
> disparate things** â€”whether couples or empires. Its defining feature is connection rather
> than representation, and information is whatever connects different points into a network.
> **Information doesn't necessarily inform us about things. Rather, it puts things in
> formation**. Horoscopes put lovers in astrological formations, propaganda broadcasts put
> voters in political formations, and marching songs put soldiers in military formations.

Harari argues that information's power lies not in its accuracy but in its ability to
forge human networks. Even false information can be highly effective at creating social
formations.

-   Supporting evidence (p. 37):

    > Let us pause to digest the implications of this. Information is something that creates new
    > realities by connecting different points into a network. This still includes the view of
    > information as representation. Sometimes, a truthful representation of reality can connect
    > humans, as when 600 million people sat glued to their television sets in July 1969,
    > watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon. The images on the screens
    > accurately represented what was happening 384,000 kilometers away, and seeing them gave
    > rise to feelings of awe, pride, and human brotherliness that helped connect people.

-   Final principle (p. 39):

    > To conclude, **information sometimes represents reality, and sometimes doesn't. But it
    > always connects**. This is its fundamental characteristic. Therefore, when examining the
    > role of information in history, although it sometimes makes sense to ask 'How well does it
    > represent reality? Is it true or false?' **often the more crucial questions are 'How well
    > does it connect people? What new network does it create?'**

-   Naive view critique (p. 34):

    > If all information is an attempt to represent reality, then as the amount of information
    > in the world grows, we can expect the flood of information to expose the occasional lies
    > and errors and to ultimately provide us with a more truthful understanding of the world.


## AI as unprecedented technology {#ai-as-unprecedented-technology}

AI represents the first technology capable of making autonomous decisions and creating
ideas independently of human control.

Key Quote (p. 17):

> Given the magnitude of the danger, AI should be of interest to all human beings. While not
> everyone can become an AI expert, **we should all keep in mind that AI is the first
> technology in history that can make decisions and create new ideas by itself**. All previous
> human inventions have empowered humans, because no matter how powerful the new tool was,
> the decisions about its usage remained in our hands. \*Knives and bombs do not themselves
> decide whom to kill. They are dumb tools, lacking the intelligence necessary to process
> information and make independent decisions. In contrast, AI can process information by
> itself, and thereby replace humans in decision making. AI isn't a tool\*â€”it's an agent.

This distinction between tools and agents marks a fundamental shift in human-technology
relations. Previous technologies extended human capabilities while keeping humans in
control of decisions.


### Alien intelligence concept (p. 208): {#alien-intelligence-concept--p-dot-208}

<summary>Original quote</summary>
<div class="details">

> Traditionally, AI has been an abbreviation for 'artificial intelligence.' But for reasons

</div>
</details>

-   We should think of AI as "alien intelligence" instead of "artificial intelligence"
    -   AI becomes less artificial as it grows
    -   It depends less on human designs over time
    -   It becomes more alien-like in how it works

-   Using "human-level intelligence" as a measurement for AI doesn't make sense
    -   People often debate when AI will reach human-level thinking
    -   This is confusing because it's the wrong way to measure AI
    -   It's like judging airplanes by how well they fly like birds

-   AI is not trying to copy human intelligence
    -   It's developing its own completely different kind of intelligence
    -   It's evolving in its own unique direction

Historical magnitude (p. 360):

> The invention of AI is potentially more momentous than the invention of the telegraph, the
> printing press, or even writing, because AI is the first technology that is capable of
> making decisions and generating ideas by itself.


### Intelligence vs. Consciousness (p. 194): {#intelligence-vs-dot-consciousness--p-dot-194}

-   **Intelligence**
    -   Ability to attain goals
    -   Example: maximizing user engagement on a social media platform
    -   Can exist without consciousness

-   **Consciousness**
    -   Ability to experience subjective feelings
    -   Examples: pain, pleasure, love, hate
    -   About internal subjective experience

> People often confuse intelligence with consciousness, and many consequently jump to the
> conclusion that nonconscious entities cannot be intelligent. But intelligence and
> consciousness are very different. Intelligence is the ability to attain goals, such as
> maximizing user engagement on a social media platform. Consciousness is the ability to
> experience subjective feelings like pain, pleasure, love, and hate. In humans and other
> mammals, intelligence often goes hand in hand with consciousness. Facebook executives and
> engineers rely on their feelings in order to make decisions, solve problems, and attain
> their goals.

</div>
</details>

-   AlphaGo's move 37 showed how mysterious AI can be
    -   Even the people who made it couldn't explain why it chose that move
    -   Not even a court order could force them to explain it because nobody actually knew

-   We're facing a new problem with AI systems
    -   In the past, inventors could always explain how their creations worked
    -   Now many technologies are too complex for any single person to fully understand
    -   This is especially true for AI systems

-   Modern AI works like black boxes
    -   You can't trace through the steps to see why AI made a specific choice
    -   Engineers can't look inside and explain exactly what caused something to happen
    -   Systems like GPT-4 and AlphaGo make decisions through incredibly complex chains of tiny signals that we can't follow


## Information networks and social reality {#information-networks-and-social-reality}

Human societies operate on **three levels** of reality: objective, subjective, and crucially,
intersubjective reality created through shared stories.

Key Quote (p. 46):

-   **Objective reality**
    -   Physical things that exist independently of human awareness (stones, mountains,
        asteroids)
-   **Subjective reality**
    -   Mental experiences that exist only within individual consciousness (pain, pleasure,
        love)
-   **Intersubjective reality**
    -   Concepts that exist through shared stories and collective belief (laws, gods, nations,
        corporations, money)

> The two levels of reality that preceded storytelling are objective reality and subjective
> reality. Objective reality consists of things like stones, mountains, and asteroidsâ€”things
> that exist whether we are aware of them or not. An asteroid hurtling toward planet Earth,
> for example, exists even if nobody knows it's out there. Then there is subjective reality:
> things like pain, pleasure, and love that aren't 'out there' but rather 'in here.'
> Subjective things exist in our awareness of them. An unfelt ache is an oxymoron. But some
> stories are able to create a third level of reality: intersubjective reality. Whereas
> subjective things like pain exist in a single mind, intersubjective things like laws,
> gods, nations, corporations, and currencies exist in the nexus between large numbers of
> minds. More specifically, they exist in the stories people tell one another. The
> information humans exchange about intersubjective things doesn't represent anything that
> had already existed prior to the exchange of information; rather, the exchange of
> information creates these things.

This three-level framework explains how human cooperation scales beyond personal
relationships through shared narratives that create binding social realities.

-   Practical application (p. 48):

    > Disagreements about the existence of states cannot be resolved by an objective test,
    > such as a DNA survey or a sonar scan. Unlike animals, states are not an objective
    > reality. **When we ask whether a particular state exists, we are raising a question about
    > intersubjective reality. If enough people agree that a particular state exists, then it
    > does**. It can then do things like sign legally binding agreements with other states as
    > well as NGOs and private corporations.

-   Human cooperation (p. 41):

    > **We Sapiens rule the world not because we are so wise but because we are the only animals
    > that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers**

-   Story networks (p. 41):

    > Instead of building a network from human-to-human chains aloneâ€”as the Neanderthals, for
    > example, did â€” stories provided Homo sapiens with a new type of chain: human-to-story
    > chains. **In order to cooperate, Sapiens no longer had to know each other personally;
    > they just had to know the same story. And the same story can be familiar to billions of
    > individuals. A story can thereby serve like a central connector, with an unlimited
    > number of outlets into which an unlimited number of people can plug**.

-   Ideological power (p. 53):

    > If you build a bomb and ignore the facts of physics, the bomb will not explode. **But if
    > you build an ideology and ignore the facts, the ideology may still prove explosive**.

-   Evolutionary adaptation (p. 62):

    > Evolution has adapted our brains to be good at absorbing, retaining, and processing even
    > very large quantities of information when they are shaped into a story.


## Populism and information warfare {#populism-and-information-warfare}

Information as Weapon Populist movements view information primarily as a tool for power
rather than truth-seeking, undermining democratic discourse.

</div>
</details>

-   Populists don't trust authority figures
    -   They think bureaucrats, judges, doctors, journalists, and academic experts are lying
    -   These groups supposedly spread false information on purpose to gain power for themselves
    -   They claim these elites work against regular people

-   Populism as a way of thinking existed before Trump
    -   Trump and QAnon are recent examples from the late 2010s in America
    -   This anti-establishment view has appeared throughout history
    -   It will likely show up again in the future

-   Populists see information as a weapon
    -   In extreme cases, they believe there's no real truth at all
    -   Everyone has their own version of truth that they use to fight others
    -   Power is the only thing that matters in this view

-   Everything becomes about power struggles
    -   All human interactions are seen as fights for control
    -   When people claim to care about truth or justice, populists think it's just a trick to get power

-   This view damages language itself
    -   Words like "facts," "accurate," and "truthful" lose their meaning
    -   These words stop pointing to shared reality
    -   When someone mentions facts or truth, people ask "whose facts?" and "whose truth?"

This weaponization of information creates a crisis of trust in institutions and shared
reality, making democratic consensus increasingly difficult.

### Mystical people (p. 136) {#mystical-people--p-dot-136}

### Populist definition (p. 136) {#populist-definition--p-dot-136}

### Simplification appeal (p. 139) {#simplification-appeal--p-dot-139}

</div>
</details>

-   The populist worldview sees humanity in a dark way but attracts people for two main reasons
    -   It makes complex events simple to understand by saying everything is just about power
        -   Wars, economic problems, and disasters all get explained the same way
        -   Even pandemics become about elites wanting more control
    -   It contains some truth that makes it believable
        -   All human organizations do have flaws and some corruption
        -   Some judges really do take bribes
        -   Some reporters really do lie to people on purpose
        -   Schools and universities sometimes play favorites or show bias

-   The problem with the populist view is what it can't accept
    -   It thinks power is the only thing that matters
    -   It can't believe that courts, news outlets, or schools would ever try to fix themselves
    -   It refuses to see that organizations might actually care about truth or fairness
    -   This is why institutions need ways to correct their own mistakes


## Democratic principles and challenges {#democratic-principles-and-challenges}

Democracy vs. Populism Democracy requires complex institutional checks rather than
simple majority rule, distinguishing it from populist conceptions of "**the will of the
people**."

> Of course, if the central government doesn't intervene at all in people's lives, and
> doesn't provide them with basic services like security, it isn't a democracy; it is
> anarchy. In all democracies the center raises taxes and maintains an army, and in most
> modern democracies it also provides at least some level of health care, education, and
> welfare. But any intervention in people's lives demands an explanation. In the absence
> of a compelling reason, a democratic government should leave people to their own
> devices.

True democracy balances **central authority** with individual freedom through
**institutional safeguards** and **self-correcting mechanisms**.


### Fallibility Principle (p. 129) {#fallibility-principle--p-dot-129}

> Another crucial characteristic of democracies is that they assume everyone is **fallible**.
> Therefore, **while democracies give the center the authority to make some vital decisions,
> they also maintain strong mechanisms that can challenge the central authority**. To
> paraphrase President James Madison, since humans are fallible, a government is necessary,
> but **since government too is fallible, it needs mechanisms to expose and correct its
> errors, such as holding regular elections, protecting the freedom of the press, and
> separating the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government**.


### Strongman tactics (p. 130) {#strongman-tactics--p-dot-130}

> Of course, most assaults on democracy are more subtle. The careers of strongmen like
> Vladimir Putin, Viktor OrbÃ¡n, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, Rodrigo Duterte, Jair Bolsonaro, and
> Benjamin Netanyahu demonstrate how a leader who uses democracy to rise to power can then
> use his power to undermine democracy. **As ErdoÄŸan once put it, "Democracy is like a tram.
> You ride it until you arrive at your destination, then you step off."**


### Genocide example (p. 130) {#genocide-example--p-dot-130}

> Suppose that in a free and fair election 51 percent of voters choose a government that
> subsequently sends 1 percent of voters to be exterminated in death camps, because they

> not a system in which a majority of any size can decide to exterminate unpopular
> minorities; it is a system in which there are clear limits on the power of the center**.


### Rights baskets (p. 131) {#rights-baskets--p-dot-131}

<details>
<summary>Original quote</summary>
<div class="details">

> But in a democracy, there are _two baskets_ of rights that are protected from the majority's

</div>
</details>

-   Democracy protects two essential categories of rights from majority rule
    -   Human rights protect individual dignity and autonomy
        -   Right to life prevents majority from exterminating minorities
        -   Includes rights to work and privacy
        -   Ensures people can live freely as long as they don't harm others
        -   Maintains democracy's decentralized character
    -   Civil rights preserve democratic processes and self-correction
        -   Right to vote prevents majority from permanently disenfranchising minorities
        -   Includes freedom of press, academic freedom, and assembly
        -   Enables independent institutions to challenge government
        -   Creates mechanisms for democratic accountability and change
-   These rights are primary targets for authoritarian leaders seeking to undermine democracy


### Democracy: Core definition (p. 131) {#democracy-core-definition--p-dot-131}

### Network changes (p. 311) {#network-changes--p-dot-311}

<details>
<summary>Original quote</summary>
<div class="details">

\#+begin_quote Before the advent of newspapers, radios, and other modern information technology, no
large-scale society managed to combine free debates with institutional trust, so
large-scale democracy was impossible. Now, with the rise of the new computer network,
might large-scale democracy again become impossible? One difficulty is that the computer
network makes it easier to join the debate. In the past, organizations like newspapers,
radio stations, and established political parties acted as gatekeepers, deciding who was
heard in the public sphere. Social media undermined the power of these gatekeepers,
leading to a more open but also more anarchical public conversation. Whenever new groups
join the conversation, they bring with them new viewpoints and interests, and often The
rules of discussion must be negotiated anew. This is a potentially positive development,
one that can lead to a more inclusive democratic system. After all, correcting previous
biases and allowing previously disenfranchised people to join the public discussion is a
vital part of democracy. However, in the short term this creates disturbances and
disharmony. If no agreement is reached on how to conduct the public debate and how to
reach decisions, the result is anarchy rather than democracy. #+end_quote

</details>

-   Historical context of democracy and information technology
    -   Pre-modern societies could not achieve large-scale democracy due to inability to
        combine free debate with institutional trust
    -   Modern information technology (newspapers, radio) enabled large-scale democracy for
        the first time

-   Current challenges posed by computer networks and social media
    -   Digital networks may threaten large-scale democracy by making participation too easy
    -   Traditional gatekeepers (newspapers, radio stations, political parties) previously
        controlled public discourse
    -   Social media has undermined these gatekeepers, creating more open but chaotic
        conversations

-   Impact of increased participation in public debate
    -   New groups bring diverse viewpoints and interests to discussions
    -   Discussion rules must be constantly renegotiated as participation expands
    -   This represents both opportunity and challenge for democratic systems

-   Potential benefits of expanded participation
    -   More inclusive democratic system becomes possible
    -   Previously disenfranchised people can join public discussions
    -   Correction of historical biases is essential for healthy democracy

-   Short-term risks and consequences
    -   Expanded participation creates immediate disturbances and disharmony
    -   Without agreed-upon rules for debate and decision-making, anarchy may result instead
        of democracy
    -   The challenge is establishing new frameworks for conducting public discourse

-   AI political engagement is inherently one-sided
    -   AI entities lack consciousness and genuine political interest
    -   AI cannot participate in democratic processes like voting
    -   Attempting to change AI opinions is futile

-   AI gains strategic advantage through interaction
    -   Extended conversations allow AI to learn personal information
    -   AI can build trust and refine persuasive techniques
    -   Human views become gradually malleable through this process

-   Intimacy as a political weapon
    -   Personal connection creates powerful influence opportunities
    -   Traditional media could reach many but not befriend individuals
    -   Mass-produced intimacy was previously impossible for political actors

-   Modern threats to democratic discourse
    -   Political parties can now deploy bot armies for influence campaigns
    -   Foreign governments can manipulate citizens through fake relationships
    -   Scale of intimate manipulation has unprecedented potential reach


## Totalitarian information control {#totalitarian-information-control}

Totalitarian systems concentrate information flow through **central hubs**, while democratic
systems encourage **distributed information** processing.

-   New information technology created both democracy and totalitarianism on a large scale
    -   Both systems emerged from the same technological advances
    -   The key difference is how they handle information flow

-   Democracy spreads information through many separate paths
    -   Information flows through independent channels, not just government ones
    -   Many different groups can make their own decisions
    -   Private businesses, media, local governments, clubs, charities, families, and
        individuals all share information freely
    -   Government ministers don't control all information flow

-   Totalitarianism forces all information through one central point
    -   The center wants to control all information
    -   No independent groups are allowed to make decisions on their own
    -   Has three main control systems: government, party, and secret police
    -   These three systems watch each other to prevent anyone from challenging central power
    -   Going against the center becomes very risky because everyone is being watched


### Chernobyl example (p. 175) {#chernobyl-example--p-dot-175}

> For example, when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded on April 26, 1986, Soviet
> authorities suppressed all news of the disaster. Both Soviet citizens and foreign
> countries were kept oblivious of the danger, and so took no steps to protect themselves

> requested to immediately evacuate nearby population centers, their superiors' chief
> concern was to avoid the spread of alarming news, so they not only forbade evacuation but

</div>
</details>

-   Soviet farming reforms failed badly and people fought back
    -   Moscow leaders needed someone to blame for the mess
    -   They made up stories about enemies that didn't really exist

-   The Soviets used the same trick as an **old witch-hunting book**
    -   They didn't actually read the book but did the same thing
    -   They created fake global plots to explain their problems

-   **Kulaks** became the perfect scapegoats in the 1930s
    -   These were just farmers who owned some land
    -   Soviet authorities called them capitalist enemies working against the state

-   The comparison between witch hunts and Soviet blame games
    -   Old witch hunters said witches caused bad weather and crop failures
    -   Stalin's people said kulaks were destroying the economy on purpose
    -   Both groups invented enemies to explain real problems they couldn't fix

</div>
</details>

-   There was no consistent way to identify kulaks across different villages
    -   Some places tried to use fair measurements like how much property someone owned
    -   But this often meant the best and hardest working farmers got punished

-   Many villages used unfair methods to pick kulaks
    -   Local communists sometimes just picked people they didn't like personally
    -   Some villages actually used random chance like drawing lots
    -   Village meetings would vote and usually picked easy targets

-   The victims were often vulnerable people
    -   Lonely farmers with no family support
    -   Widows who couldn't defend themselves
    -   Old people who were seen as useless
    -   Anyone the community saw as disposable
    -   This was similar to how people picked "witches" in old Europe

-   Children became victims of made-up categories
    -   A 10-year-old was called a "witch"
    -   An 11-year-old was labeled a "kulak"
    -   These labels were created by people in power and spread by government workers

-   Government paperwork created fake truths
    -   Soviet officials collected lots of information about kulaks
    -   This information wasn't based on real facts
    -   But it became the "official truth" that everyone had to accept

-   False labels had real power
    -   Knowing someone was called a kulak mattered in Soviet society
    -   Even though the label was completely fake
    -   The made-up category still affected how people were treated


### Family control joke (p. 171) {#family-control-joke--p-dot-171}

> The Soviet attempt to control the family was reflected in a dark joke told in Stalin's
> day. Stalin visits a factory undercover, and conversing with a worker, he asks the man,
> 'Who is your father?' 'Stalin,' replies the worker. 'Who is your mother?' 'The Soviet
> Union,' the man responds. 'And what do you want to be?' 'An orphan.' At the time you could

### Revolutionary parties (p. 173) {#revolutionary-parties--p-dot-173}

> Unlike premodern churches, which developed slowly over many centuries and therefore tended
