## Quotes {#citations}


### About sprouting {#about-sprouting}

> Sprouting to me is like gardening with steroids


### Change food mindset {#change-food-mindset}

> Instead of a big bowl of spaghetti with some veggies and lentils on top, I think
> of a big bowl of vegetables with some pasta and lentils mixed in. Instead of a
> big plate of brown rice with some stir-fried vegetables on top, I picture a meal
> that''s some rice and beans in there too.


### Is healthy food more expensive? {#is-healthy-food-more-expensive}

> Nowadays, we know better and can compare the cost of foods based on their
> nutritional content. An average serving of vegetables may cost roughly four
> times more than the average serving of junk food, but those veggies have been
> calculated to average twenty-four times more nutrition. So on a
> cost-per-nutrition basis, vegetables offer six times more nutrition per dollar
> compared to highly processed foods. Meat costs about three times more than
> vegetables yet yields sixteen times less nutrition based on an aggregate of
> nutrients.4 Because meat is less nutritious and costs more, vegetables net you
> forty-eight times more nutrition per dollar than meat.


### On food education {#on-food-education}

> Most deaths in the united states are preventable, and they are related to what
> we eat. Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one
> cause of disability. Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in
> medical schools, right?
