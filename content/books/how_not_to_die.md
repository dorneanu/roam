## Summary {#summary}

The book consists of 3 parts:

1.  **First part** is about major diseases people in the USA die from. Each chapter describes root causes and foods that have (scientifically proven!) been found to reduce the risk or even cure the disease

2.  **In the 2nd part** of the book the author devotes his attention to healthy food groups. He specifically writes about which elements inside ingredients/foods are responsible for preventing/curing a disease

The first 2 parts are full of references to scientific papers and provide evidence for the authors statements.

1.  **The 3rd part** of the book contains the full list of references which IMHO is a tremendous amount of research effort.

In general the author keeps emphasizing that a plant-based nutrition could prevent most of the diseases our society suffers from. But for the industry plants don't really pay the bills. For this reason the pharma industry has a huge interest in promoting their pills over a healthy nutrition. We're constantly eating ourselves to an early unnecessary death while giving lots of money to the industry.

Dr. Greger also has a donation based, non-profit website where all the books contents have gone to. He doesn't offer any products and also avoids any (branded) food recommendations. For me it seems he doesn't have any motivation to sell something there.

> Everything on []][[#NutritionFacts][NutritionFacts](https://nutritionfacts.org/).org is provided absolutely
> free of charge. There's no special member area where you pay a fee to get extra
> lifesaving information. What membership websites seem to be saying, in essence,
> is that if you don't give them money, they'll withhold information that could
> make your family healthier. That's unacceptable to me. Advances in health
> sciences should be freely available and accessible to all

**Now about the bad stuff**:

-   his ultimate recommendation is that everyone should become a vegan (although he doesn't stick to any "diet"-ism)
-   he doesn't recommend olive oil for which there are many (also scientifically proven) positive health benefits
-   also avoids fermented milk which again has scientific evidence for healthy benefits

Here are my notes.


## From heart disease {#from-heart-disease}

-   Nutrition plays an important role
    -   1930-1940s several studies between Western and non-Western population revealed that heart attack disease was almost absent in the non-Western countries
    -   similar results in "[The China Study](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/178788.The%5FChina%5FStudy)"
-   Main reason for plaque buildup is [cholesterol](/zk/cholesterol)
    -   Optimal level: 50/70 mg/dL
    -   Especially LDL [cholesterol](/zk/cholesterol)
        -   The vehicle by which chesterol is deposited into arteries
    -   Main sources
        -   trans fat
        -   saturated fat
        -   dietary cholesterol (eggs)
-   Fish oil
    -   no evidence of positive benefits against heart attack/stroke
    -   check out studies: [DART, DART-2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456725/)


## From lung diseases {#from-lung-diseases}

-   "[White coat project](https://tobaccotactics.org/wiki/influencing-science-funding-scientists/)"
    -   by Philipp Morris in the 80s


## From digestive cancers {#from-digestive-cancers}

-   Meat
    -   check out [NIH-AARP](https://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/) study
    -   study over a decade
    -   545000 men and women (between 50-71)
    -   results: meat consumption increased mortality
    -   Possible explanation
        -   excess of iron (as in blood or muscle) can generate cancer-causing free radicals
        -   human body has no mechanism to get rid of excess iron
        -   check out [heme iron](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heme-iron/)


## From liver diseases {#from-liver-diseases}

-   based on alcohol


### Types {#types}


#### Non-alcoholic {#non-alcoholic}

-   also known as fatty liver disease
-   starts with buildup of fat depósitos (usually no symptoms)
-   is a process over the years that leads to cirhosis and then to liver cancer
-   can also be caused by colesterol overload
-   also see [viral hepatitis](/zk/viral-hepatitis)


### How to protect the liver {#how-to-protect-the-liver}

-   eat oat meels
-   cranberries (contain [anthocyanins](https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2010/05/19/Cranberry-anthocyanins-show-low-levels-of-bioavailability-study), a sub-group of flavonoids)
-   drink coffee


## From kidney disease {#from-kidney-disease}

-   lead to declining kidney function
    -   animal proteins
    -   animal fat
    -   cholesterol
-   One explanation: animal food contains more acids
    -   recommendation: alkalic food
-   [Acid load to kidneys](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/protein-source-an-acid-test-for-kidney-function/)


## From prostata cancer {#from-prostata-cancer}

-   Sources of cancer
    -   Eggs
        -   contain [choline](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/choline/): is converted into a toxin called trimethylamine
    -   Milk
        -   also im fermented Form
-   Flaxseeds supress cancer growth


## Part 2 {#part-2}

The second part is of the book is more about what you can do/eat in order to be healthy.

-   Whenever asked if a certain food is healthy or not: **Compared to to what?**

### Change food mindset {#change-food-mindset}

### Is healthy food more expensive? {#is-healthy-food-more-expensive}

> Nowadays, we know better and can compare the cost of foods based on their
> nutritional content. An average serving of vegetables may cost roughly four
> times more than the average serving of junk food, but those veggies have been

> cost-per-nutrition basis, vegetables offer six times more nutrition per dollar
> compared to highly processed foods. Meat costs about three times more than
> vegetables yet yields sixteen times less nutrition based on an aggregate of

### On food education {#on-food-education}

> Most deaths in the united states are preventable, and they are related to what
