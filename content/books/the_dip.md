## The Dip {#the-dip}

> At the beginning, when you first start something, it's fun. You could be taking up golf or acupuncture or piloting a plane or doing chemistry-doesn't matter; it's interesting, and you get plenty of good feedback from the people around you.
>
> Over the next few days and weeks, the rapid learning you experience keeps you going. Whatever your new thing is, it's easy to stay engaged in it.
>
> And then the Dip happens.
>
> **The Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery**. A long slog that's actually a shortcut, because it gets you where you want to go faster than any other path.
>
> The Dip is the combination of bureaucracy and busywork you must deal with in order to get certified in scuba diving. The Dip is the difference between the easy "beginner"


## Cul the sac {#cul-the-sac}

> The **Cul-de-Sac** (French for "**dead end**") is so simple it doesn't even need a chart. It's **a situation where you work and you work and you work and nothing much changes**. It doesn't get a lot better, it doesn't get a lot worse. It just is.
>
> That's why they call those jobs dead-end jobs. There's not a lot to say about the Cul-de-Sac except to realize that it exists and to embrace the fact that when you find one, you need to get off it, fast. That's because a dead end is keeping you from doing something else. The opportunity cost of investing your life in something that's not going to get better is just too high.
>
> That's it. Two big curves (a bonus, the Cliff, follows). **Stick with the Dips that are likely to pan out, and quit the Cul-de-Sacs to focus your resources**. That's it.
