## Constitutional Challenges and Democratic Reform {#constitutional-challenges-and-democratic-reform}


### Aging Constitution (p.17) {#aging-constitution--p-dot-17}

The Constitution, while providing stability, now threatens democracy through its
pre-democratic design.

> That leads us to another unsettling truth. Part of the problem we face today lies in
> something many of us venerate: our Constitution. America has **the world's oldest written
> constitution**. A brilliant work of political craftsmanship, it has provided a foundation
> for stability and prosperity. And for more than two centuries it has succeeded in checking
> the power of ambitious and overreaching presidents. But **flaws in our Constitution now
> imperil our democracy**. Designed in a **pre-democratic era**, the U.S. Constitution allows
> **partisan minorities to routinely thwart majorities**, and sometimes even govern them.
> Institutions that empower partisan minorities can become **instruments of minority rule**. And
> they are especially dangerous when they are in the hands of **extremist or antidemocratic
> partisan minorities**.


### Historical Minority Rule (p.127) {#historical-minority-rule--p-dot-127}

The three-fifths clause gave slave states disproportionate representation.

> The biggest victory for the southern states, however, was the notorious **"three-fifths
> clause,"** which allowed them to **count enslaved people as part of each state's population**
> (five slaves counted as three free persons) for the purposes of legislative apportionment,
> even though slaves had no rights. This expanded the **slave states' representation in the
> House**, which also increased their influence in the Electoral College. In this way, the
> southern slaveholding minority achieved its demand for what the South Carolina delegate
> Charles Pinckney called "something like an equality." For example, in 1790,
> **Massachusetts's voting population was greater than Virginia's**, but since Virginia had
> 300,000 slaves


## Current Democratic Challenges {#current-democratic-challenges}


### Racial Inequality (p.13) {#racial-inequality--p-dot-13}

The disparate treatment of citizens based on race remains evident in the justice system.

> If you have any doubt that **Black citizens do not enjoy the same rights under the law as
> white citizens**, apply the Kyle Rittenhouse test: Could a **young Black man cross state
> lines with a semiautomatic rifle, walk unmolested by police into a protest, fire into a
> crowd, kill two people, and go free?**


### Democratic Decline (p.14) {#democratic-decline--p-dot-14}

U.S. democracy shows significant decline in global rankings since 2015.

> Freedom House's Global Freedom Index gives countries a score between 0 and 100 each year,
> with 100 being the most democratic. In 2015, the United States received a score of **90**,
> which was roughly in line with countries like Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan,
> Spain, and the U.K. But after that, **America's score declined steadily, reaching 83 in
> 2021**. Not only was that score **lower than every established democracy in western Europe**,
> but it was **lower than new or historically troubled democracies** like Argentina, the Czech
> Republic, Lithuania, and Taiwan.


### Senate Representation Imbalance (p.143) {#senate-representation-imbalance--p-dot-143}

Republican senators have consistently represented a minority of Americans in the 21st
century.

> Or look at it another way: **At no time during the twenty-first century have Senate
> Republicans represented a majority of the U.S. population**. Based on states' populations,
> Senate Democrats have continuously represented more Americans since 1999. In the 2016
> election, for example, the Republicans won a fifty-two-seat Senate majority. But their
> senators represented **only 45 percent of Americans**. In 2018, the GOP won a fifty-three-seat
> majority, but again, its senators represented only a minority (**48 percent**) of Americans.
> After the 2020 election, which left the Senate evenly split, the **fifty Democratic
> senators represented 55 percent of Americansâ€”41.5 million more people than the fifty
> Republican senators**. The pattern continued in 2022: the GOP continued to hold more Senate
> seats (forty-nine) than its vote share (**42 percent**).


## Principles of Democracy {#principles-of-democracy}


### Democratic Acceptance (p.21) {#democratic-acceptance--p-dot-21}

Democracy requires accepting electoral losses.

> As the political scientist Adam Przeworski memorably put it, **"Democracy is a system in
> which parties lose elections."** Losing hurts, but in a democracy it is inevitable. And when
> it happens, parties must do what the Peronists did: **accept defeat, go home, and then
> figure out how to win a majority in the next election**.


### Core Democratic Requirements (p.40) {#core-democratic-requirements--p-dot-40}

Three fundamental commitments required of democratic politicians.

> Politicians who are committed to democracy, or what the political scientist Juan Linz
> called **loyal democrats**, must always do **three basic things**. First, they must **respect the
> outcome of free and fair elections, win or lose**. This means consistently and
> unhesitatingly accepting defeat. Second, democrats must **unambiguously reject violence** (or
> the threat of violence) as a means of achieving political goals. Politicians who support
> military coups, organize putsches, incite insurrections, plot bombings, assassinations,
> and other terrorist acts, or deploy militias or thugs to beat up opponents or intimidate
> voters are not democrats. Indeed, any party or politician that violates either of these
> two basic rules should be considered **a threat to democracy**. But there is a third, more
> subtle action required of loyal democrats: they must **always break with antidemocratic
> forces**. Democracy's assassins always have accomplicesâ€”political insiders who appear to
> abide by democracy's rules but quietly assault them.


### Democratic Enablers (p.41) {#democratic-enablers--p-dot-41}

The danger of mainstream parties tolerating extremists.

> Democracies get into trouble when **mainstream parties tolerate, condone, or protect
> authoritarian extremists\*â€”when they become \*authoritarian enablers**. Indeed, throughout
> history, **cooperation between authoritarians and seemingly respectable semi-loyal democrats
> has been a recipe for democratic breakdown**.


### Balance of Powers (p.115) {#balance-of-powers--p-dot-115}

Democracy requires both majority rule and minority rights protection.

> Part of the answer is that **democracy needs rules that limit the power of majorities**.
> Modern democracy is **not simply a system of majority rule**; it combines **majority rule and
> minority rights**. Early defenders of limited government feared excessive concentrations of
> powerâ€”not only in the hands of kings, but also in the hands of popular majorities. And so
> the form of democracy that emerged in the West between the late eighteenth and the
> twentieth centuries, which today we call **"liberal" democracy**, is based on **two pillars:
> collective self-rule (majority rule) and civil liberties (minority rights)**. Although
> liberal democracy cannot exist without free and fair elections, **not everything can or
> should be up for grabs in elections**.


### Constraints on Majority Power (p.117) {#constraints-on-majority-power--p-dot-117}

Majorities must be prevented from undermining democratic competition.

> Majorities must also be constrained in a second area: **the rules of democracy itself**.
> Elected governments must **not be able to use their temporary majorities to entrench
> themselves in power** by changing the rules of the game in ways that weaken their opponents
> or undermine fair competition. This is the specter of **"majority tyranny"**: the possibility
> that a government will use its popular or parliamentary majority to **vote the
> oppositionâ€”and democracyâ€”out of existence**.


## Democratic Reform Strategies {#democratic-reform-strategies}


### Broad Coalition Building (p.179) {#broad-coalition-building--p-dot-179}

Historical examples of democratic forces uniting against extremism.

> One strategy, born in the darkest days of 1930s Europe, is to **corral all democratic-minded
> forces into a broad coalition to isolate and defeat antidemocratic extremists**. Facing the
> specter of a global wave of fascism, many of Europe's new democracies came to the brink of
> collapse between the two world wars. In some countries, **mainstream politicians responded
> by setting aside their intense ideological differences and forging broad left-right
> coalitions to defend democracy**. Acute crises call for extraordinary cooperation; leaders
> of rival parties realized they needed to **temporarily set aside their policy goals and
> forge a common pro-democratic front**, both at election time and while governing.


### Electoral Competition (p.181) {#electoral-competition--p-dot-181}

Madison's principle of using electoral competition to overcome extremism.

> Here we return to a basic principle inspired by James Madison and others: **Extremist
> minorities are best overcome through electoral competition**. Madison believed that the **need
> to win popular majorities would likely tame the most "sinister" political tendencies**. But
> his formula requires that **popular majorities actually prevail in elections**. For that to
> happen, America must reform its institutions. The early twentieth century American
> reformer Jane Addams once wrote, **"The cure for the ills of Democracy is more Democracy."**


### Voting Rights and Access (p.182-183) {#voting-rights-and-access--p-dot-182-183}

The need for constitutional voting rights and easier voting access.

> In the United States, to the surprise of many, there is **no constitutional or even
> statutory "right to vote."** The Second Amendment affirmed Americans' right to bear arms,
> but **nowhere does the Constitution recognize their right to suffrage**. Later amendments
> specified that suffrage may not be denied on the basis of race (Fifteenth Amendment) or
> sex (Nineteenth Amendment), but **never has the Constitution positively affirmed Americans'
> right to vote**. Likewise, although there are many federal laws protecting voting, no single
> federal statute grants all adult citizens the right to cast a ballot. Unlike most
> established democracies, the United States has **a long history of governments discouraging
> and even suppressing the vote**.


### Comprehensive Reforms (p.183-185) {#comprehensive-reforms--p-dot-183-185}

Detailed proposals for democratic reforms.

> This means we should do the following: **Pass a constitutional amendment establishing a
> right to vote** for all citizens, which would provide a solid basis to litigate voting
> restrictions. **Establish automatic registration** in which all citizens are registered to
> vote when they turn eighteen. This could be accompanied by the automatic distribution of
> national voting ID cards to all citizens. **Expand early voting and easy mail-in voting
> options** for citizens of all states. It should be easy for all Americans to cast ballots.
> **Make Election Day a Sunday or a national holiday**, so that work responsibilities do not
> discourage Americans from voting. **Restore voting rights** (without additional fines or fees)
> to all ex-felons who have served their time. **Restore national-level voting rights
> protections**.


## Historical Perspective and Future Vision {#historical-perspective-and-future-vision}


### Historical Change (p.187) {#historical-change--p-dot-187}

The possibility of achieving seemingly impossible reforms.

> Just because an idea is not taken seriously today doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken
> seriouslyâ€”or that it won't be taken seriously in the future. During the early nineteenth
> century, the idea of **ending slavery was considered unthinkable** in mainstream America, and
> abolitionists were dismissed as dreamers. When the **women's suffrage movement was born in
> the 1840s, no country in the world granted women the right to vote**. Well into the
> twentieth century, mainstream America considered the idea of women's suffrage absurd. And
> for decades after the Civil War, the pursuit of **racial equality and civil rights was seen
> as impracticable, if not impossible**. In each case, **the mainstream view changed radically**.
> But for that to happen, **someone had to start a public conversation**.


### Power of Ideas (p.188) {#power-of-ideas--p-dot-188}

The importance of proposing new ideas for change.

> When institutional change happens, participants often quote the French poet Victor Hugo's
> line **"Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come."** But **an idea's time can
> only come if someone has proposed it**.


### Founders' Vision (p.190) {#founders-vision--p-dot-190}

The Founders' recognition of the need for constitutional evolution.

> The founders actually knew this. They were **not wedded to the original version of the
> Constitution**. They **recognized the limitations of their creation** and believed that later
> generations wouldâ€”and shouldâ€”modify them. In 1787, just after the Philadelphia Convention,
> George Washington wrote, "The warmest friends and best supporters the Constitution has, do
> not contend that it is free from imperfections; but found them unavoidable." If problems
> arose from these imperfections, Washington wrote, "the remedy must come hereafter." He
> went on to write that the American people **"can, as they will have the advantage of
> experience on their Side, decide with as much propriety on the alterations and amendments
> which are necessary as ourselves. I do not think we are more inspired, have more wisdom,
> or possess more virtue, than those who will come after us."**


### Democratic Action (p.200) {#democratic-action--p-dot-200}

The necessity of active engagement in democratic reform.

> If there is one thing we've learned from democracy movements, past and present, it's this:
> **Democratic reform doesn't just happen. It is made.**


### Call to Action (p.202) {#call-to-action--p-dot-202}

The imperative to build an inclusive democracy.

> Defending democracy is not the work of selfless heroes. **Standing up for democracy means
> standing up for ourselves**. Think back to the scenes from January 5 and January 6 that
> opened this book. What kind of society do we want to live in? Think of the millions of
> Americansâ€”young and old, religious and secular, of every imaginable skin colorâ€”who took to
> the streets in the name of justice in the summer of 2020. The young people who marched
> that summer could have turned away from the system, but they **turned out to vote instead**. A
> new generation of Americans stood up to defend our imperfect democracy. But they also
> showed us a vision of a better democracyâ€”\*a democracy for all\*. As the civil rights
> generation passes into history, **the work of building a truly multiracial democracy falls
> upon us**. Future generations will hold us to account.
