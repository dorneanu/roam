## Chapters {#chapters}


### Part 1: The Crack in the old story (27) {#part-1-the-crack-in-the-old-story--27}


#### The Wand (28) {#the-wand--28}

With any drug there always comes a story:

> But Irving was also one of the leading experts in the world in a field of science that
> began right back in Bath when John Haygarth first waved his false wand. At that time, the
> English doctor had realized that when you give a patient a medical treatment, you are
> really giving her **two things**. **You are giving her a drug, which will usually have a
> chemical effect on her body in some way. And you are giving her a story—about how the
> treatment will affect her**.

Prozac and some false research:

> He learned right away that the drug companies had—for years—been selectively publishing
> research, and to a greater degree than he expected. **For example, in one trial for Prozac,
> the drug was given to 245 patients, but the drug company published the results for only
> twenty-seven of them**. **Those twenty-seven patients9 were the ones the drug seemed to work**

The Hamilton scale:

> Scientists measure the depth of someone’s depression using something named the Hamilton
> scale, which was invented by a scientist named Max Hamilton in 1959. **The Hamilton scale
> ranges from 0 (where you’re skipping along merrily) to 51 (where you’re jumping in front
> of trains)**. To give you a yardstick: you can get a six-point leap in your Hamilton score
> if you improve your sleeping patterns. What Irving found is that, in the real data that
> hadn’t been run through a PR filter, antidepressants do cause an improvement in the
> Hamilton score—\*they do make depressed people feel better. It’s an improvement of 1.8
> points\*.

Irvin Kirsch:

> When **Irving Kirsch** discovered that these [serotonin](../../topics/serotonin.md)-boosting drugs were not having the
> effects that everyone was being sold, he began—to his surprise—to ask an even more basic
> question. **What’s the evidence, he began to wonder, that depression is caused primarily by
> an imbalance of serotonin, or any other chemical, in the brain? Where did it come from?**


#### Imbalance (38) {#imbalance--38}

> After twenty years researching this at the highest level, Irving has come to believe that
> the notion depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is just “an accident of history,”
> produced by scientists initially misreading what they were seeing, and then drug companies
> selling that misperception to the world to cash in. And so, Irving says, the primary
> explanation for depression offered in our culture starts to fall apart. The idea you feel
> terrible because of a “chemical imbalance” was built on a series of mistakes and errors.
> It has come as close to being proved wrong, he told me, as you ever get in science. It’s
> lying broken on the floor, like a neurochemical Humpty Dumpty with a very sad smile.

-   Depression cause: Irving views the "chemical imbalance" explanation as an "accident of history."
-   Origin: Resulted from initial scientific misinterpretations and subsequent pharmaceutical company promotion.
-   Cultural understanding: Current primary explanation for depression is falling apart.
-   Chemical imbalance theory: Largely discredited in science.
-   Current state: Theory is "lying broken on the floor."


#### The Grief Exception (50) {#the-grief-exception--50}

> But this blasts a hole in the rudder of the boat the psychiatrists writing the DSM have
> been sailing in for so long. Suddenly, life—with all its complexity—starts to flood into
> diagnosing depression and anxiety. It can’t just be a matter of chemical imbalance, as
> verified by checklists of symptoms. It would have to be seen as a response to your
> circumstances.

Depression as a disconnection from ourselves, from others:

> As she said this, I told her that in thirteen years of being handed ever higher doses of
> antidepressants, no doctor ever asked me if there was any reason why I might be feeling so
> distressed. She told me I’m not unusual—and it’s a disaster. The message my doctors gave
> me—\*that our pain is simply a result of a malfunctioning brain—makes us, she told me,
> “disconnected from ourselves, which leads to disconnection from others\*.”

Mental health should be become emotional health:

> In most cases, Joanne says, we would have to stop talking about “mental health”—which
> conjures pictures of brain scans and defective synapses—and start talking about “emotional
> health.” “\*Why do we call it mental health?” she asked me. “Because we want to scientize
> it. We want to make it sound scientific. But it’s our emotions.\*”

Depression as a form of grief:

> I was beginning to think there was something significant about the fact that grief and
> depression have identical symptoms. Then one day, after interviewing several depressed
> people, I asked myself: What if depression is, in fact, a form of grief—for our own lives
> not being as they should? What if it is a form of grief for the connections we have lost,
> yet still need?


#### The First Flag on the Moon (57) {#the-first-flag-on-the-moon--57}


### Part 2: Disconnection: Nine Causes of Depression {#part-2-disconnection-nine-causes-of-depression}


#### Picking up the flag (69) {#picking-up-the-flag--69}


#### Cause one: Disconnection from meaningful work (71) {#cause-one-disconnection-from-meaningful-work--71}

> As a result of this research, and the science it opened up, “the notion of what
> constitutes stress at work has undergone a revolution,” Michael explains. The worst stress
> for people isn’t having to bear a lot of responsibility. It is, he told me, having to
> endure “work [that] is monotonous, boring, soul-destroying; [where] they die a little when
> they come to work each day, because their work touches no part of them that is them.” Joe,
> then, in his paint shop, by this real standard, had one of the most stressful jobs there
> is. “Disempowerment,” Michael told me, “is at the heart12 of poor health”—physical,
> mental, and emotional.

-   Stress at work: Definition revolutionized by research findings.
-   Worst stress factor: Monotonous, boring, soul-destroying work.
-   Impact: Work that doesn't engage individuals leads to physical, mental, and emotional health issues.


#### Cause two: Disconnection from other people (83) {#cause-two-disconnection-from-other-people--83}

On being "homesick":

> When we talk about home today, we mean just our four walls and (if we’re lucky) our
> nuclear family. But that’s never been what home has meant to any humans before us. To
> them, it meant a community—a dense web of people all around us, a tribe. But that is
> largely gone. **Our sense of home has shriveled so far and so fast it no longer meets our
> need for a sense of belonging. So we are homesick even when we are at home**.

Why people post on social media:

> The comedian Marc Maron once wrote that “\*every status update is a just a variation on a
> single request: ‘Would someone please acknowledge me?\*’

<!--quoteend-->

> There’s a quote from the biologist E. O. Wilson that John Cacioppo—who has taught us so
> much about loneliness—likes: **“People must belong to a tribe.” Just like a bee goes haywire
> if it loses its hive, a human will go haywire if she loses her connection to the group**.


#### Cause three: Disconnection from meaninful values (102) {#cause-three-disconnection-from-meaninful-values--102}

Consumerism &amp; work:

> And the pressure, in our culture, runs overwhelmingly one way—\*spend more; work more\*. We
> live under a system, Tim says, that constantly “distracts us from what’s really good about
> life.” We are being propagandized to live in a way that doesn’t meet our basic
> psychological needs—\*so we are left with a permanent, puzzling sense of dissatisfaction\*.

Intrinsic vs extrinsic values:

> “On Friday at four, I can stay [in my office] and work more—or I can go home and play with
> my kids,” he told me. “I can’t do both. It’s one or the other. If my materialistic values
> are bigger, I’m going to stay and work. If my family values are bigger, I’m going to go
> home and play with my kids.” It’s not that materialistic people don’t care about their
> kids—but “\*as the materialistic values get bigger, other values are necessarily going to be
> crowded out,” he says, even if you tell yourself they won’t\*.

Advertising makes us feel bad:

> Tim suspected that advertising plays a key role in why we are, every day, choosing a value
> system that makes us feel worse. So with another social scientist named Jean Twenge,21 he
> tracked the percentage of total U.S. national wealth that’s spent on advertising, from
> 1976 to 2003—and he discovered that the more money is spent on ads, the more materialistic
> teenagers become. A few years ago, an advertising agency head named Nancy Shalek22
> explained approvingly: “\*Advertising at its best is making people feel that without their
> product, you’re a loser. Kids are very sensitive to that … You open up emotional
> vulnerabilities, and it’s very easy to do with kids because they’re the most emotionally
> vulnerable\*.

Adertising and the ego:

> When they talk among themselves, **advertising people have been admitting since the 1920s
> that their job is to make people feel inadequate—and then offer their product as the
> solution to the sense of inadequacy they have created**. Ads are the ultimate
> frenemy—they’re always saying: Oh babe, I want you to look/smell/feel great; it makes me
> so sad that that at the moment you’re ugly/stinking/miserable; here’s this thing that will
> make you into the person you and I really want you to be. Oh, did I mention you have to
> pay a few bucks? I just want you to be the person you deserve to be. Isn’t that worth a
> few dollars? **You’re worth it**.

<!--quoteend-->

> One of his proudest moments was when one of his sons came home one day and said: “Dad,
> some kids at school are making fun of my sneakers.” They were not a brand name, or
> shiny-new. “Oh, what’d you say to them?” Tim asked. His son explained he looked at them
> and said: “\*Why do you care?\*” He was nonplussed—he could see that what they valued was
> empty, and absurd.

Problem with shopping malls:

> “But I think part of why people are depressed is that our society is not set up in order
> to help people live lifestyles, have jobs, participate in the economy, [or] participate in
> their neighborhoods” in ways that support their intrinsic values. The change Tim saw
> happening in Florida as a kid—when the beachfronts were transformed into shopping malls
> and people shifted their attention there—has happened to the whole cultur


#### Cause four: Disconnection from childhood trauma (117) {#cause-four-disconnection-from-childhood-trauma--117}

Obesity and the real causes:

> “When you look at a house burning down, the most obvious manifestation is the huge smoke
> billowing out,” he told me. It would be easy, then, to think that the smoke is the
> problem, and if you deal with the smoke, you’ve solved it. But “thank God that fire
> departments understand that the piece that you treat is the piece you don’t see—the flames
> inside, not the smoke billowing out. Otherwise, house fires would be treated by bringing
> big fans to blow the smoke away. [And that would] make the house burn down faster.”
> **Obesity, he realized, isn’t the fire. It’s the smoke**.

<!--quoteend-->

> turned out that **for every category of traumatic experience you went through as a kid, you
> were radically more likely to become depressed as an adult**. If you had six categories of
> traumatic events in your childhood, you were five times9 more likely to become depressed
> as an adult than somebody who didn’t have any. If you had seven categories of traumatic
> events as a child, you were 3,100 percent more likely to attempt to commit suicide as an
> adult.

Depression and emotional abuse:

> Curiously, it turned out emotional abuse was more likely to cause depression than any
> other kind of trauma—even sexual molestation. Being treated cruelly by your parents was
> the biggest driver of depression, out of all these categories.


#### Cause five: Disconnection from status and respect (128) {#cause-five-disconnection-from-status-and-respect--128}

> After I learned about this, I began to wonder—especially as I interviewed many depressed
> people—\*if depression is, in part, a response to the sense of humiliation the modern world
> inflicts on many of us\*. **Watch TV and you’ll be told the only people who count in the world
> are celebrities and the rich—and you already know your chances of joining either group are
> vanishingly small**. Flick through an Instagram feed or a glossy magazine, and your
> normal-shaped body will feel disgusting to you. Go to work and you’ll have to obey the
> whims of a distant boss earning hundreds of times more than you. Even when we are not
> being actively humiliated, even more of us feel like our status could be taken away at any
> moment. Even the middle class—even the rich—are being made to feel pervasively insecure.
> **Robert had discovered that having an insecure status was the one thing even more
> distressing than having a low status**.


#### Cause six: Disconnection from the natural world (136) {#cause-six-disconnection-from-the-natural-world--136}


#### Cause seven: Disconnection from a hopeful or secure future (146) {#cause-seven-disconnection-from-a-hopeful-or-secure-future--146}


#### Causes eight and nine: The real role of genes and brain changes (158) {#causes-eight-and-nine-the-real-role-of-genes-and-brain-changes--158}

Being depressed for a long time causes increased nervous activity in specific brain areas:

> Because you are feeling intense pain for a long period, your brain will assume this is the
> state in which you are going to have to survive from now on—so it might start to shed the
> synapses that relate to the things that give you joy and pleasure, and strengthen the
> synapses that relate to fear and despair. **That’s one reason why you can often start to
> feel you have become somehow fixed in a state of depression or anxiety even if the
> original causes of the pain seem to have passed**. John

Genes and depression:

> Yet there was a catch. We are all born with a genetic inheritance—but your genes are
> activated by the environment. They can be switched on, or off, by what happens to you. And
> Avshalom discovered—as Professor Robert Sapolsky explains—“that if you have a particular
> flavor of 5-HTT, you have a greatly increased risk of depression, but only in a certain
> environment.” If you carried this gene, the study showed, you were more likely to become
> depressed—but only if you had experienced a terribly stressful event, or a great deal of
> childhood trauma. (They didn’t test for most of the other causes of depression I’ve been
> talking about here, such as loneliness, so we don’t know if they also interact with genes
> in this way

-   Genetic inheritance: Genes can be activated or deactivated by environmental factors.
-   Depression risk: Carrying a specific gene variant increases depression risk only in
    certain environments.
-   Risk factors: Increased likelihood of depression with a stressful event or childhood
    trauma.
-   Interaction with genes: Some causes of depression may interact with genes in a similar
    fashion.

Feminism in the 1950s:

> Picture a 1950s housewife living before modern feminism.She goes to her doctor to say
> there is something terribly wrong with her. She says something like: “I have everything a
> woman could possibly want. I have a good husband who provides for me. I have a nice house
> with a picket fence. I have two healthy children. I have a car. I have nothing to be
> unhappy about. But look at me—I feel terrible. I must be broken inside. Please—can I have
> some Valium?” The feminist classics talk a lot about women like this. There were millions
> of women saying things just like it. And the women meant what they said. They were
> sincere. Yet now, if we could go back in a time machine and talk to these women, what we’d
> say is: You had everything a woman could possibly want by the standards of the culture.
> You had nothing to be unhappy about by the standards of the culture. But we now know that
> the standards of the culture were wrong. Women need more than a house and a car and a
> husband and kids. They need equality, and meaningful work, and autonomy. You aren’t
> broken, we’d tell them. The culture is.

-   Societal standards: Emphasized traditional gender roles and domesticity for women.
-   Unrealistic expectations: Women felt unfulfilled despite having material comfort.
-   Cultural perception: Happiness equated to having a good husband, children, and a home.
-   Feminist critique: Highlighted the need for equality, meaningful work, and autonomy for women.
-   Empowerment: Challenged the idea that women were inherently broken for desiring more
    than societal norms.

> It turns out that you were more likely to hurt somebody if you believed their mental
> illness was the result of their biochemistry than if you believed it was the result of
> what had happened to them in life. Believing depression was a disease didn’t reduce
> hostility. In fact, it increased it.

See depression as a reaction to the way we are living:

> This experiment—like so much of what I had learned—hints at something. For a long time, we have been told there are only two ways of thinking about depression. Either it’s a moral failing—a sign of weakness—or it’s a brain disease. Neither has worked well in ending depression, or in ending its stigma. But everything I had learned suggests that there’s a third option—to regard depression as largely a reaction to the way we are living

<!--quoteend-->

> “Things have changed in psychiatry,”24 he said—and he then explained to me two more
> crucial reasons why we are being told stories only about our brains and our genes.
> “Psychiatry has undergone a real constriction from this bio-psycho-social approach. While
> some people still pay lip service to it, mainstream psychiatry has become very
> biological.” He furrowed his brow. “It’s very problematic.” We have ended up with “a
> grossly oversimplified picture” of depression that he said “doesn’t look at social factors
> … But at a deeper level for me, it doesn’t look at basic human processes.” One reason why
> is that it is “much more politically challenging”25 to say that so many people are feeling
> terrible because of how our societies now work. It fits much more with our system of
> “neoliberal capitalism,” he told me, to say, “Okay, we’ll get you functioning more
> efficiently, but please don’t start questioning … because that’s going to destabilize all
> sorts of things.” This observation fits, he believes, with the other big key reason. “The
> pharmaceutical [companies] are major forces shaping a lot of psychiatry, because it’s this
> big, big business—billions of dollars,” he said. They pay the bills, so they largely set
> the agenda, and they obviously want our pain to be seen as a chemical problem with a
> chemical solution. The result is that we have ended up, as a culture, with a distorted
> sense of our own distress. He looked at me. The fact that “the entire program of
> psychiatric research should look like [this],” he said, “is really disturbing.”

-   Psychiatry evolution: Shift towards a more biological perspective on mental health.
-   Critique of oversimplification: Lack of consideration for social and human processes in
    understanding depression.
-   Political challenges: Reluctance to attribute widespread distress to societal factors
    due to potential disruptions in the existing system.
-   Influence of pharmaceutical companies: Significant role in shaping psychiatric practices
    and promoting a chemical-centric approach to mental health.
-   Distorted cultural perception: Results in an incomplete understanding and treatment of
    mental distress.
-   Concerning state of psychiatric research: Emphasis on chemical solutions raises concerns
    about the broader approach to mental health.
