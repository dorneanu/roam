## Chapters {#chapters}


### Part 1: The Crack in the old story (27) {#part-1-the-crack-in-the-old-story--27}


#### The Wand (28) {#the-wand--28}

With any drug there always comes a story:

> But Irving was also one of the leading experts in the world in a field of science that
> began right back in Bath when John Haygarth first waved his false wand. At that time, the
> English doctor had realized that when you give a patient a medical treatment, you are
> really giving her **two things**. **You are giving her a drug, which will usually have a
> chemical effect on her body in some way. And you are giving her a story—about how the
> treatment will affect her**.

Prozac and some false research:

> He learned right away that the drug companies had—for years—been selectively publishing
> research, and to a greater degree than he expected. **For example, in one trial for Prozac,
> the drug was given to 245 patients, but the drug company published the results for only
> twenty-seven of them**. **Those twenty-seven patients9 were the ones the drug seemed to work**

The Hamilton scale:

> Scientists measure the depth of someone’s depression using something named the Hamilton
> scale, which was invented by a scientist named Max Hamilton in 1959. **The Hamilton scale
> ranges from 0 (where you’re skipping along merrily) to 51 (where you’re jumping in front
> of trains)**. To give you a yardstick: you can get a six-point leap in your Hamilton score
> if you improve your sleeping patterns. What Irving found is that, in the real data that
> hadn’t been run through a PR filter, antidepressants do cause an improvement in the
> Hamilton score—\*they do make depressed people feel better. It’s an improvement of 1.8
> points\*.

Irvin Kirsch:

> When **Irving Kirsch** discovered that these [serotonin]({{< relref "../../topics/serotonin.md" >}})-boosting drugs were not having the
> effects that everyone was being sold, he began—to his surprise—to ask an even more basic
> question. **What’s the evidence, he began to wonder, that depression is caused primarily by
> an imbalance of serotonin, or any other chemical, in the brain? Where did it come from?**


#### Imbalance (38) {#imbalance--38}

> After twenty years researching this at the highest level, Irving has come to believe that
> the notion depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is just “an accident of history,”
> produced by scientists initially misreading what they were seeing, and then drug companies
> selling that misperception to the world to cash in. And so, Irving says, the primary
> explanation for depression offered in our culture starts to fall apart. The idea you feel
> terrible because of a “chemical imbalance” was built on a series of mistakes and errors.
> It has come as close to being proved wrong, he told me, as you ever get in science. It’s
> lying broken on the floor, like a neurochemical Humpty Dumpty with a very sad smile.

-   Depression cause: Irving views the "chemical imbalance" explanation as an "accident of history."
-   Origin: Resulted from initial scientific misinterpretations and subsequent pharmaceutical company promotion.
-   Cultural understanding: Current primary explanation for depression is falling apart.
-   Chemical imbalance theory: Largely discredited in science.
-   Current state: Theory is "lying broken on the floor."


#### The Grief Exception (50) {#the-grief-exception--50}

> But this blasts a hole in the rudder of the boat the psychiatrists writing the DSM have
> been sailing in for so long. Suddenly, life—with all its complexity—starts to flood into
> diagnosing depression and anxiety. It can’t just be a matter of chemical imbalance, as
> verified by checklists of symptoms. It would have to be seen as a response to your
> circumstances.

Depression as a disconnection from ourselves, from others:

> As she said this, I told her that in thirteen years of being handed ever higher doses of
> antidepressants, no doctor ever asked me if there was any reason why I might be feeling so
> distressed. She told me I’m not unusual—and it’s a disaster. The message my doctors gave
> me—\*that our pain is simply a result of a malfunctioning brain—makes us, she told me,
> “disconnected from ourselves, which leads to disconnection from others\*.”

Mental health should be become emotional health:

> In most cases, Joanne says, we would have to stop talking about “mental health”—which
> conjures pictures of brain scans and defective synapses—and start talking about “emotional
> health.” “\*Why do we call it mental health?” she asked me. “Because we want to scientize
> it. We want to make it sound scientific. But it’s our emotions.\*”

Depression as a form of grief:

> I was beginning to think there was something significant about the fact that grief and
> depression have identical symptoms. Then one day, after interviewing several depressed
> people, I asked myself: What if depression is, in fact, a form of grief—for our own lives
> not being as they should? What if it is a form of grief for the connections we have lost,
> yet still need?


#### The First Flag on the Moon (57) {#the-first-flag-on-the-moon--57}


### Part 2: Disconnection: Nine Causes of Depression {#part-2-disconnection-nine-causes-of-depression}


#### Picking up the flag (69) {#picking-up-the-flag--69}


#### Cause one: Disconnection from meaningful work (71) {#cause-one-disconnection-from-meaningful-work--71}

> As a result of this research, and the science it opened up, “the notion of what
> constitutes stress at work has undergone a revolution,” Michael explains. The worst stress
> for people isn’t having to bear a lot of responsibility. It is, he told me, having to
> endure “work [that] is monotonous, boring, soul-destroying; [where] they die a little when
> they come to work each day, because their work touches no part of them that is them.” Joe,
> then, in his paint shop, by this real standard, had one of the most stressful jobs there
> is. “Disempowerment,” Michael told me, “is at the heart12 of poor health”—physical,
> mental, and emotional.

-   Stress at work: Definition revolutionized by research findings.
-   Worst stress factor: Monotonous, boring, soul-destroying work.
-   Impact: Work that doesn't engage individuals leads to physical, mental, and emotional health issues.


#### Cause two: Disconnection from other people (83) {#cause-two-disconnection-from-other-people--83}

On being "homesick":

> When we talk about home today, we mean just our four walls and (if we’re lucky) our
> nuclear family. But that’s never been what home has meant to any humans before us. To
> them, it meant a community—a dense web of people all around us, a tribe. But that is
> largely gone. **Our sense of home has shriveled so far and so fast it no longer meets our
> need for a sense of belonging. So we are homesick even when we are at home**.

Why people post on social media:

> The comedian Marc Maron once wrote that “\*every status update is a just a variation on a
> single request: ‘Would someone please acknowledge me?\*’

<!--quoteend-->

> There’s a quote from the biologist E. O. Wilson that John Cacioppo—who has taught us so
> much about loneliness—likes: **“People must belong to a tribe.” Just like a bee goes haywire
> if it loses its hive, a human will go haywire if she loses her connection to the group**.


#### Cause three: Disconnection from meaninful values (102) {#cause-three-disconnection-from-meaninful-values--102}

Consumerism &amp; work:

> And the pressure, in our culture, runs overwhelmingly one way—\*spend more; work more\*. We
> live under a system, Tim says, that constantly “distracts us from what’s really good about
> life.” We are being propagandized to live in a way that doesn’t meet our basic
> psychological needs—\*so we are left with a permanent, puzzling sense of dissatisfaction\*.

Intrinsic vs extrinsic values:

> “On Friday at four, I can stay [in my office] and work more—or I can go home and play with
> my kids,” he told me. “I can’t do both. It’s one or the other. If my materialistic values
> are bigger, I’m going to stay and work. If my family values are bigger, I’m going to go
> home and play with my kids.” It’s not that materialistic people don’t care about their
> kids—but “\*as the materialistic values get bigger, other values are necessarily going to be
> crowded out,” he says, even if you tell yourself they won’t\*.

Advertising makes us feel bad:

> Tim suspected that advertising plays a key role in why we are, every day, choosing a value
> system that makes us feel worse. So with another social scientist named Jean Twenge,21 he
> tracked the percentage of total U.S. national wealth that’s spent on advertising, from
> 1976 to 2003—and he discovered that the more money is spent on ads, the more materialistic
> teenagers become. A few years ago, an advertising agency head named Nancy Shalek22
> explained approvingly: “\*Advertising at its best is making people feel that without their
> product, you’re a loser. Kids are very sensitive to that … You open up emotional
> vulnerabilities, and it’s very easy to do with kids because they’re the most emotionally
> vulnerable\*.

Adertising and the ego:

> When they talk among themselves, **advertising people have been admitting since the 1920s
> that their job is to make people feel inadequate—and then offer their product as the
> solution to the sense of inadequacy they have created**. Ads are the ultimate
> frenemy—they’re always saying: Oh babe, I want you to look/smell/feel great; it makes me
> so sad that that at the moment you’re ugly/stinking/miserable; here’s this thing that will
> make you into the person you and I really want you to be. Oh, did I mention you have to
> pay a few bucks? I just want you to be the person you deserve to be. Isn’t that worth a
> few dollars? **You’re worth it**.

<!--quoteend-->

> One of his proudest moments was when one of his sons came home one day and said: “Dad,
> some kids at school are making fun of my sneakers.” They were not a brand name, or
> shiny-new. “Oh, what’d you say to them?” Tim asked. His son explained he looked at them
> and said: “\*Why do you care?\*” He was nonplussed—he could see that what they valued was
> empty, and absurd.

Problem with shopping malls:

> “But I think part of why people are depressed is that our society is not set up in order
> to help people live lifestyles, have jobs, participate in the economy, [or] participate in
> their neighborhoods” in ways that support their intrinsic values. The change Tim saw
> happening in Florida as a kid—when the beachfronts were transformed into shopping malls
> and people shifted their attention there—has happened to the whole cultur


#### Cause four: Disconnection from childhood trauma (117) {#cause-four-disconnection-from-childhood-trauma--117}

Obesity and the real causes:

> “When you look at a house burning down, the most obvious manifestation is the huge smoke
> billowing out,” he told me. It would be easy, then, to think that the smoke is the
> problem, and if you deal with the smoke, you’ve solved it. But “thank God that fire
> departments understand that the piece that you treat is the piece you don’t see—the flames
> inside, not the smoke billowing out. Otherwise, house fires would be treated by bringing
> big fans to blow the smoke away. [And that would] make the house burn down faster.”
> **Obesity, he realized, isn’t the fire. It’s the smoke**.

<!--quoteend-->

> turned out that **for every category of traumatic experience you went through as a kid, you
> were radically more likely to become depressed as an adult**. If you had six categories of
> traumatic events in your childhood, you were five times9 more likely to become depressed
> as an adult than somebody who didn’t have any. If you had seven categories of traumatic
> events as a child, you were 3,100 percent more likely to attempt to commit suicide as an
> adult.

Depression and emotional abuse:

> Curiously, it turned out emotional abuse was more likely to cause depression than any
> other kind of trauma—even sexual molestation. Being treated cruelly by your parents was
> the biggest driver of depression, out of all these categories.


#### Cause five: Disconnection from status and respect (128) {#cause-five-disconnection-from-status-and-respect--128}

> After I learned about this, I began to wonder—especially as I interviewed many depressed
> people—\*if depression is, in part, a response to the sense of humiliation the modern world
> inflicts on many of us\*. **Watch TV and you’ll be told the only people who count in the world
> are celebrities and the rich—and you already know your chances of joining either group are
> vanishingly small**. Flick through an Instagram feed or a glossy magazine, and your
> normal-shaped body will feel disgusting to you. Go to work and you’ll have to obey the
> whims of a distant boss earning hundreds of times more than you. Even when we are not
> being actively humiliated, even more of us feel like our status could be taken away at any
> moment. Even the middle class—even the rich—are being made to feel pervasively insecure.
> **Robert had discovered that having an insecure status was the one thing even more
> distressing than having a low status**.


#### Cause six: Disconnection from the natural world (136) {#cause-six-disconnection-from-the-natural-world--136}


#### Cause seven: Disconnection from a hopeful or secure future (146) {#cause-seven-disconnection-from-a-hopeful-or-secure-future--146}


#### Causes eight and nine: The real role of genes and brain changes (158) {#causes-eight-and-nine-the-real-role-of-genes-and-brain-changes--158}

Being depressed for a long time causes increased nervous activity in specific brain areas:

> Because you are feeling intense pain for a long period, your brain will assume this is the
> state in which you are going to have to survive from now on—so it might start to shed the
> synapses that relate to the things that give you joy and pleasure, and strengthen the
> synapses that relate to fear and despair. **That’s one reason why you can often start to
> feel you have become somehow fixed in a state of depression or anxiety even if the
> original causes of the pain seem to have passed**. John

Genes and depression:

> Yet there was a catch. We are all born with a genetic inheritance—but your genes are
> activated by the environment. They can be switched on, or off, by what happens to you. And
> Avshalom discovered—as Professor Robert Sapolsky explains—“that if you have a particular
> flavor of 5-HTT, you have a greatly increased risk of depression, but only in a certain
> environment.” If you carried this gene, the study showed, you were more likely to become
> depressed—but only if you had experienced a terribly stressful event, or a great deal of
> childhood trauma. (They didn’t test for most of the other causes of depression I’ve been
> talking about here, such as loneliness, so we don’t know if they also interact with genes
> in this way

-   Genetic inheritance: Genes can be activated or deactivated by environmental factors.
-   Depression risk: Carrying a specific gene variant increases depression risk only in
    certain environments.
-   Risk factors: Increased likelihood of depression with a stressful event or childhood
    trauma.
-   Interaction with genes: Some causes of depression may interact with genes in a similar
    fashion.

Feminism in the 1950s:

> Picture a 1950s housewife living before modern feminism.She goes to her doctor to say
> there is something terribly wrong with her. She says something like: “I have everything a
> woman could possibly want. I have a good husband who provides for me. I have a nice house
> with a picket fence. I have two healthy children. I have a car. I have nothing to be
> unhappy about. But look at me—I feel terrible. I must be broken inside. Please—can I have
> some Valium?” The feminist classics talk a lot about women like this. There were millions
> of women saying things just like it. And the women meant what they said. They were
> sincere. Yet now, if we could go back in a time machine and talk to these women, what we’d
> say is: You had everything a woman could possibly want by the standards of the culture.
> You had nothing to be unhappy about by the standards of the culture. But we now know that
> the standards of the culture were wrong. Women need more than a house and a car and a
> husband and kids. They need equality, and meaningful work, and autonomy. You aren’t
> broken, we’d tell them. The culture is.

-   Societal standards: Emphasized traditional gender roles and domesticity for women.
-   Unrealistic expectations: Women felt unfulfilled despite having material comfort.
-   Cultural perception: Happiness equated to having a good husband, children, and a home.
-   Feminist critique: Highlighted the need for equality, meaningful work, and autonomy for women.
-   Empowerment: Challenged the idea that women were inherently broken for desiring more
    than societal norms.

> It turns out that you were more likely to hurt somebody if you believed their mental
> illness was the result of their biochemistry than if you believed it was the result of
> what had happened to them in life. Believing depression was a disease didn’t reduce
> hostility. In fact, it increased it.

See depression as a reaction to the way we are living:

> This experiment—like so much of what I had learned—hints at something. For a long time, we
> have been told there are only two ways of thinking about depression. Either it’s a moral
> failing—a sign of weakness—or it’s a brain disease. Neither has worked well in ending
> depression, or in ending its stigma. But everything I had learned suggests that there’s a
> third option—to regard depression as largely a reaction to the way we are living

<!--quoteend-->

> “Things have changed in psychiatry,”24 he said—and he then explained to me two more
> crucial reasons why we are being told stories only about our brains and our genes.
> “Psychiatry has undergone a real constriction from this bio-psycho-social approach. While
> some people still pay lip service to it, mainstream psychiatry has become very
> biological.” He furrowed his brow. “It’s very problematic.” We have ended up with “a
> grossly oversimplified picture” of depression that he said “doesn’t look at social factors
> … But at a deeper level for me, it doesn’t look at basic human processes.” One reason why
> is that it is “much more politically challenging”25 to say that so many people are feeling
> terrible because of how our societies now work. It fits much more with our system of
> “neoliberal capitalism,” he told me, to say, “Okay, we’ll get you functioning more
> efficiently, but please don’t start questioning … because that’s going to destabilize all
> sorts of things.” This observation fits, he believes, with the other big key reason. “The
> pharmaceutical [companies] are major forces shaping a lot of psychiatry, because it’s this
> big, big business—billions of dollars,” he said. They pay the bills, so they largely set
> the agenda, and they obviously want our pain to be seen as a chemical problem with a
> chemical solution. The result is that we have ended up, as a culture, with a distorted
> sense of our own distress. He looked at me. The fact that “the entire program of
> psychiatric research should look like [this],” he said, “is really disturbing.”

-   Psychiatry evolution: Shift towards a more biological perspective on mental health.
-   Critique of oversimplification: Lack of consideration for social and human processes in
    understanding depression.
-   Political challenges: Reluctance to attribute widespread distress to societal factors
    due to potential disruptions in the existing system.
-   Influence of pharmaceutical companies: Significant role in shaping psychiatric practices
    and promoting a chemical-centric approach to mental health.
-   Distorted cultural perception: Results in an incomplete understanding and treatment of
    mental distress.
-   Concerning state of psychiatric research: Emphasis on chemical solutions raises concerns
    about the broader approach to mental health.


### Part 3: Reconnection; or, A different kind of antidepressant {#part-3-reconnection-or-a-different-kind-of-antidepressant}


#### The cow (172) {#the-cow--172}

> As I traveled in Southeast Asia meeting people in similar situations, and after I walked
> away from my long conversation with Derek, I began to ask myself for the first time—What
> if we have just been defining antidepressants in the wrong way? We have thought of
> antidepressants solely as the pills we swallow once (or more) a day. But what if we
> started to think of antidepressants as something very different? What if changing the way
> we live—in specific, targeted, evidence-based ways—could be seen as an antidepressant,
> too? What if what we need to do now is expand our idea of what an antidepressant is?

Depression as **disconnection**:

> Now, though, I had to answer a different question, she told me. “How different would it
> be,” she said,3 “if when you went to your doctor, she ‘diagnosed’ us with
> ‘disconnection’?” What would happen then?

<!--quoteend-->

> I quickly discovered that this question has been studied even less than the causes of
> depression and anxiety. You could fill aircraft hangars with studies of what happens in
> the brain of a depressed person. You could fill an aircraft with the research that’s been
> conducted into the social causes of depression and anxiety. And you could fill a toy
> airplane with the research into reconnection.


#### We built this city (177) {#we-built-this-city--177}

👉 Example at Koti (in Berlin)

> “We built this city. We are not the scumbags of society. We have a right to the city,
> because we built this neighborhood.” It wasn’t the investors demanding higher rents who
> made this city livable, “it’s everybody.


#### Reconnection one: To other people (192) {#reconnection-one-to-other-people--192}

> For example—take a group of Western friends, and show them a picture of a man addressing a
> crowd. Ask them to describe what they see. Then approach the next group of Chinese
> tourists you see, show them the same picture, and ask them to describe it. The Westerners
> will almost always describe the individual at the front of the crowd first, in a lot of
> detail—then they describe the crowd. For Asians, it’s the other way around:2 they’ll
> usually describe the crowd, and then, afterward, almost as an afterthought, they’ll
> describe the guy at the front. Or take a picture of a little girl who is smiling broadly,
> in the middle of a group of other little girls who look sad. Show it to some kids and ask
> them—does this girl in the middle seem happy or sad to you? Western kids think she is
> happy. Asian kids think she is sad. Why? Because the Western kids have no problem
> isolating an individual from the group, whereas Asian kids take it for granted that if a
> kid is surrounded by distress, she’ll be distressed, too. In other words: in the West, we
> mostly have an individualistic way of looking at life. In Asia, they mostly have a
> collective way of looking at life.

-   Western Outlook
    -   Focus on individual first
    -   Detailed observation of the individual
    -   Crowd described afterward
-   Asian Perspective
    -   Focus on the group first
    -   Individual mentioned later, less detailed
-   Interpretations of Emotions
    -   Western kids: Individual emotions are separate from the group
    -   Asian kids: Individual emotions influenced by the group's emotions
-   Underlying Philosophies
    -   Western: Individualism
    -   Asian: Collectivism
    -   The cultural lens affects perception and interpretation of social dynamics

Be the crowd:

> But what I was being taught is—if you want to stop being depressed, don’t be you. Don’t be
> yourself.3 Don’t fixate on how you’re worth it. It’s thinking about you, you, you that’s
> helped to make you feel so lousy. Don’t be you. Be us. Be we. Be part of the group. Make
> the group worth it. The real path to happiness, they were telling me, comes from
> dismantling our ego walls—from letting yourself flow into other people’s stories and
> letting their stories flow into yours; from pooling your identity, from realizing that you
> were never you—alone, heroic, sad—all along. No, don’t be you. Be connected with everyone
> around you. Be part of the whole. Don’t strive to be the guy addressing the crowd. Strive
> to be the crowd.


#### Reconnection two: Social prescribing (203) {#reconnection-two-social-prescribing--203}

"What matters to you?":

> He says he has learned, especially with depression and anxiety, to shift from asking
> **“What’s the matter with you?” to “What matters to you?”** If you want to find a solution,
> you need to listen to what’s missing in the depressed or anxious person’s life—and help
> them to find a way to resolving this, the underlying problem.


#### Reconnection three: To meaningful work (215) {#reconnection-three-to-meaningful-work--215}

> As I sat with Meredith and watched the bike repairs happening all around us, I remembered
> what I had learned from Michael Marmot, the social scientist who carried out the research
> into British civil servants that showed the ways in which our work can make us sick,
> physically or mentally. He had explained to me: It’s not the work itself that makes you
> sick. It’s three other things. It’s the feeling of being controlled—of being a meaningless
> cog in a system. It’s the feeling that no matter how hard you work, you’ll be treated just
> the same and nobody will notice—an imbalance, as he puts it, between efforts and rewards.
> And it’s the feeling of being low on the hierarchy—of being a low-status person who
> doesn’t matter compared to the Big Man in the corner office.


#### Reconnection four: To meaningful values (226) {#reconnection-four-to-meaningful-values--226}


#### Reconnection five: Sympathetic joy, and overcoming addiction to the self (234) {#reconnection-five-sympathetic-joy-and-overcoming-addiction-to-the-self--234}

Universal basic income in Canada:

> In the middle of the 1970s, a group of Canadian government officials chose1—apparently at
> random—a small town called Dauphin in the rural province of Manitoba. It was, they knew,
> nothing special to look at. The nearest city, Winnipeg, was a four-hour drive away. It lay
> in the middle of the prairies, and most of the people living there were farmers growing a
> crop called canola. Its seventeen thousand people worked as hard as they could, but they
> were still struggling. When the canola crop was good, everyone did well—the local car
> dealership sold cars, and the bar sold booze. When the canola crop was bad, everyone
> suffered. And then one day the people of Dauphin were told they had been chosen to be part
> of an experiment, due to a bold decision by the country’s Liberal government. For a long
> time, Canadians had been wondering if the welfare state they had been developing, in fits
> and starts over the years, was too clunky and inefficient and didn’t cover enough people.
> The point of a welfare state is to establish a safety net below which nobody should ever
> be allowed to fall: a baseline of security that would prevent people from becoming poor
> and prevent anxiety. But it turned out there was still a lot of poverty, and a lot of
> insecurity, in Canada. Something wasn’t working. So somebody had what seemed like an
> almost stupidly simple idea. Up to now, the welfare state had worked by trying to plug
> gaps—by catching the people who fell below a certain level and nudging them back up. But
> if insecurity is about not having enough money to live on, they wondered, what would
> happen if we just gave everyone enough, with no strings attached? What if we simply mailed
> every single Canadian citizen—young, old, all of them—a check every year that was enough
> for them to live on? It would be set at a carefully chosen rate. You’d get enough to
> survive, but not enough to have luxuries. They called it a universal basic income. Instead
> of using a net to catch people when they fall, they proposed to raise the floor on which
> everyone stands. This idea had even been mooted by right-wing politicians like Richard
> Nixon, but it had never been tried before. So the Canadians decided to do it, in one
> place. That’s how for several years, the people of Dauphin were given a guarantee: Each of
> you will be unconditionally given the equivalent of $19,000 U.S. (in today’s money) by the
> government. You don’t have to worry. There’s nothing you can do that will take away this
> basic income. It’s yours by right. And then they stood back to see what would happen.

1.  Context and Selection of Dauphin
    -   Chosen by Canadian officials
    -   Random selection for a universal basic income experiment
    -   A small, rural, and agriculture-dependent community
2.  Motivation Behind the Experiment
    -   Existing welfare system's shortcomings
    -   Persistent poverty and insecurity despite the welfare state
    -   The question of whether a baseline income could alleviate these issues
3.  Concept: Universal Basic Income
    -   A fixed, no-strings-attached income for all citizens
    -   Aimed to provide security and combat poverty efficiently
    -   Simplicity as the core idea: instead of plugging gaps, raise the floor
4.  Implementation in Dauphin
    -   Guarantee of a basic income equivalent to $19,000 USD today
    -   Income unconditional and universal
    -   Experiment to observe the social impact

Interpretations:

> At that time, over in Toronto, there was a young economics student named Evelyn Forget,
> and one day, one of her professors told the class about this experiment. She was
> fascinated. But then, three years into the experiment, power in Canada was transferred to
> a Conservative government, and the program was abruptly shut down. The guaranteed income
> vanished. To everyone except the people who got the checks—and one other person—it was
> quickly forgotten. Thirty years later, that young economics student, Evelyn, had become a
> professor at the medical school of the University of Manitoba, and she kept bumping up
> against some disturbing evidence. It is a well-established fact that the poorer you are,
> the more likely you are to become depressed or anxious—and the more likely you are to
> become sick in almost every way. In the United States, if you have an income below
> $20,000,2 you are more than twice as likely to become depressed as somebody who makes

#### Reconnection seven: Restoring the future (262) {#reconnection-seven-restoring-the-future--262}

-   👉 2024-04-15 ◦ [Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World by Rutger Bregman | Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40876575)
    -   Dutch economic historian named Rutger Bregman. He is the leading European champion of the idea of a universal basic income.

> Every now and then, Rutger—the leading European campaigner for a universal basic
> income—will read a news story about somebody who has made a radical career choice. A
> fifty-year-old man realizes he’s unfulfilled as a manager so he quits, and becomes an
> opera singer. A forty-five-year-old woman quits Goldman Sachs and goes to work for a
> charity. “It is always framed as something heroic,” Rutger told me, as we drank our tenth
> Diet Coke between us. People ask them, in awe: “\*Are you really going to do what you want
> to do?” Are you really going to change your life, so you are doing something that fulfills
> you? It’s a sign, Rutger says, of how badly off track we’ve gone, that having fulfilling
> work is seen as a freakish exception, like winning the lottery, instead of how we should
> all be living\*. Giving everyone a guaranteed basic income, he says “is actually all about
> making [it so we tell everyone]—‘\*Of course you’re going to do what you want to do. You’re
> a human being. You only live once. What would you want to do [instead]—something you don’t
> want to do?’ \*”

Reconnect again:

> You aren’t a machine with broken parts. You are an animal whose needs are not being met.
> You need to have a community. You need to have meaningful values, not the junk values
> you’ve been pumped full of all your life, telling you happiness comes through money and
> buying objects. You need to have meaningful work. You need the natural world. You need to
> feel you are respected. You need a secure future. You need connections to all these
> things. You need to release any shame you might feel for having been mistreated.

Margret Thatcher:

> When I was a child, Margaret Thatcher said, “\*There’s no such thing as society, only
> individuals and their families\*”—and, all over the world, her viewpoint won.
