## Introduction {#introduction}

-   Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks,often performed while
    distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to
    replicate
-   To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly
    learning complicated things. This task requires deepwork. If you don't cultivate this
    ability, you're likely to fall behindas technology advances.


## Deep Work {#deep-work}

-   The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare
    at exactly the same time it is becomingincreasingly valuable in our economy. As a
    consequence, the few whocultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working
    life,will thrive
-   Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free
    concentration that push your cognitive capabilities totheir limit. These efforts create
    new value, improve your skill, and arehard to replicate

#### Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy  {#two-core-abilities-for-thriving-in-the-new-economy}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed


#### The Intelectual Life {#the-intelectual-life}

> "Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let
> your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a
> dominant, wholly absorbing idea."


#### Deliberate Practice {#deliberate-practice}

-   Part of performance psychology
-   In the early 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University
-   Key components
    -   (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or
        an idea you're trying to master;
    -   (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention
        exactly where it's most productive

-  Neurological aspects

    > As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, The Talent Code, these scientists
    > increasingly believe the answer includes myelin --- a layer of fatty tissue that grows
    > around neurons,acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster andcleaner.
    > To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mindthat skills, be they
    > intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down tobrain circuits. This new science of
    > performance argues that you getbetter at a skill as you develop more myelin around the
    > relevantneurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlesslyand
    > effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated


#### Law of productivity {#law-of-productivity}

-   High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)


#### Attention residue {#attention-residue}

<!--list-separator-->

-  By “Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work?"

    > The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you
    > switch from some Task A to another Task B,your attention doesn't immediately
    > follow---a residue of your attentionremains stuck thinking about the original
    > task. This residue getsespecially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and
    > of lowintensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A beforemoving
    > on, your attention remains divided for a while


### Chapter 2: Deep Work is rare {#chapter-2-deep-work-is-rare}

-   The Principle of Least Resistance
    -   In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment
-   Busyness as Proxy for Productivity
    -   In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner


### Chapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful {#chapter-3-deep-work-is-meaningful}


#### Rapt {#rapt}

-   As Gallagher recalls in her 2009 book Rapt, as she walked away from the hospital after the diagnosis she formed a sudden and strongintuition: "This disease wanted to monopolize my attention, but as much as possible, I would focus on my life instead."
-   Her curiosity piqued, Gallagher set out to better understand the role that attention---that is, what we choose to focus on and what wechoose to ignore---plays in defining the quality of our life. After fiveyears of science reporting, she came away convinced that she was witness to a "grand unified theory" of the mind:

> Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology
> to education, behavioral economics tofamily counseling, similarly suggest that
> the skillful management ofattention is the sine qua non of the good life and the
> key to improvingvirtually every aspect of your experience


#### Flow {#flow}

-   "The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish somethingdifficult and worthwhile." Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title).

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow
> activities they have built-in goals, feedbackrules, and challenges, all of which
> encourage one to become involved inone's work, to concentrate and lose oneself
> in it. Free time, on theother hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater
> effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

-   The connection between deep work and flow should be clear
    -   Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state (the phrasesused by Csikszentmihalyi to describe what generates flow include notionsof stretching your mind to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an activity---all of which also describe deep work)

### The Rules {#the-rules}


#### Rule #1: Work deeply {#rule-1-work-deeply}

<!--list-separator-->

-  By Roy Baumeister

    -   You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. Your will, in other words, is not a manifestation of yourcharacter that you can deploy without limit; it's instead like a muscle that tires
    -   The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration

<!--list-separator-->

-  Different philosophies

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Monastic

        -   Knuth deploys what I call the monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Bimodal

        -   Jung's approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically---seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical).

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Rhythmic

        -   This chain method (as some now call it) soon became a hit among writers and fitness enthusiasts---communities that thrive on the ability to do hard things consistently. For our purposes, it provides a specific example of a general approach to integrating depth into your life: the rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Journalistic

        -   I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment's notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #1 Focus on the wildly importante

            <!--list-separator-->

            -  Aim to for a small number of wildly importantly goals

            <!--list-separator-->

            -  Let ambitious goals drove focus driven behaviour

                <!--list-separator-->

                -  The Art of Focus (David Brooks)

                    > "If you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial
                    > distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the
                    > subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd
                    > out everything else."

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #2 Act on the lead measures

            <!--list-separator-->

            -  2 types of metrics to measure the your goal

                <!--list-separator-->

                -  Lag measures

                    -   Lag measures describe the thing you're ultimately trying to improve
                    -   the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: "When you receive them, the
                        performance that drove them is already in the past."

                <!--list-separator-->

                -  Lead measures

                    -   Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.
                    -   For an individual focused on deep work, it's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal
                        -   Don't track how many books, articles you've read
                        -   Measure instead how many hours of deep work you've mastered

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #3 Keep the a compelling scoreboard

            > "People play differently when they're keeping score," the 4DX authors explain. They then elaborate that when attempting
            > to drive your team's engagement toward your organization's wildly important goal, it's important that they have a public
            > place to record and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus
            > on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation.
            > Once the team notices their success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this performance.

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #4 Create a Cadence of Accountability

            -   The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place "a rhythm of regular and

            frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal."

            -   multiple places throughout this book I discuss and recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead (see Rule #4). During my experiments with 4DX, I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to adjust my schedule to meet the needs of my lead measure---enabling significantly more deep work than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.


#### Rule #2: Embrace boredom {#rule-2-embrace-boredom}

-   Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you'll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom
-   Don't Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus
-   Productively Meditation
    -   The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally---walking, jogging, driving, showering---and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls

<!--list-separator-->

-  Attention control

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Memorize deck of cards

        -   Daniel Kilov
        -   "We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us is in a cognitive ability that's not a direct measure of memory at all but of attention," explained Roediger in a New York Times blog post (emphasis mine). The ability in question is called "attentional control," and it measures the subjects' ability to maintain their focus on essential information.
        -   The technique for card memorization I'll teach you comes from someone who knows quite a bit about this particular challenge: Ron White, a former USA Memory Champion and world record holder in card memorization.\* The first thing White emphasizes is that professional memory athletes never attempt rote memorization, that is, where you simply look at information again and again, repeating it in your head. This approach to retention, though popular among burned-out students, misunderstands how our brains work. We're not wired to quickly internalize abstract information. We are, however, really good at remembering scenes


#### Rule #3: Quit social media {#rule-3-quit-social-media}

-   Chose your tools
    -   The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts
-   Social media as source of distraction
    -   They're just products, developed by private companies, fundedlavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture thensell your personal information and attention to advertisers. They can befun, but in the scheme of your life and what you want to accomplish,they're a lightweight whimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper


#### Rule #4: Drain the Shallows {#rule-4-drain-the-shallows}

<!--list-separator-->

-  37signals/Basecamp 4-day week

    -   Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You're lucky if you geta few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, websurfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate thetypical workday. Fewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat outof the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuffdone, they respect that time even more. People become stingy with theirtime and that's a good thing. They don't waste it on things that just don't matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely.
    -   37signals' experiments highlight an important reality: The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention ofknowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. Formost businesses, if you eliminated significant amounts of thisshallowness, their bottom line would likely remain unaffected. And asJason Fried discovered, if you not only eliminate shallow work, but also replace this recovered time with more of the deep alternative, not only will the business continue to function; it can become more successful

<!--list-separator-->

-  Cognitive capacity and deep work

    -   Then there's the issue of cognitive capacity. Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities.Performance psychologists have extensively studied how much such effortscan be sustained by an individual in a given day.\* In their seminalpaper on deliberate practice, Anders Ericsson and his collaboratorssurvey these studies. They note that for someone new to such practice(citing, in particular, a child in the early stages of developing anexpert-level skill), an hour a day is a reasonable limit. For those familiar with the rigors of such activities, the limit expands to something like four hours, but rarely more


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

-   A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it's not aphilosophical statement---it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done
