## On the Importance of Deep Work {#on-the-importance-of-deep-work}


### Constantly learn new things {#constantly-learn-new-things}

> To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly
> learning complicated things. This task requires deepwork. If you don't cultivate
> this ability, you're likely to fall behind as technology advances.


### Lifelong learning {#lifelong-learning}

> The ability to perform is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it
> is becomingincreasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few whocultivate
> this skill, and then make it the core of their working life,will thrive


## Attention residue {#attention-residue}

> The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you
> switch from some Task A to another Task B,your attention doesn't immediately
> follow---a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original
> task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and
> of lowintensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A beforemoving
> on, your attention remains divided for a while.

## Part 1 {#part-1}


### Chapter 1: Deep Work is Valuable {#chapter-1-deep-work-is-valuable}

-   Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 
    -   1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 
    -   2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed


#### The Intelectual Life {#the-intelectual-life}

> "Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be
>  all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly
>  absorbing idea."


#### Law of productivity {#law-of-productivity}

-   High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)


### Chapter 2: Deep Work is rare {#chapter-2-deep-work-is-rare}


#### The Principle of Least Resistance {#the-principle-of-least-resistance}

> In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the
> bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.


#### Busyness as Proxy for Productivity {#busyness-as-proxy-for-productivity}

> In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner


### Chapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful {#chapter-3-deep-work-is-meaningful}


#### Rapt {#rapt}

> As Gallagher recalls in her 2009 book [Rapt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6262510-rapt), as she walked away from the hospital after the
> diagnosis she formed a sudden and strongintuition: "This disease wanted to monopolize my
> attention, but as much as possible, I would focus on my life instead."

<!--quoteend-->

> Her curiosity piqued, Gallagher set out to better understand the role that
> attention---that is, what we choose to focus on and what wechoose to ignore---plays in
> defining the quality of our life. After fiveyears of science reporting, she came away
> convinced that she was witness to a "**grand unified theory**" of the mind:

-  Attention management

    > Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to
    > education, behavioral economics tofamily counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful
    > management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving
    > virtually every aspect of your experience


#### Flow {#flow}

> "The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile." Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title).

<!--quoteend-->

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities
> they have built-in goals, feedbackrules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to
> become involved inone's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on
> theother hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into
> something that can be enjoyed.

-   The connection between [deep work]({{< relref "../../topics/deep_work.md" >}}) and flow should be clear
    -   deep work generates a flow state
        -   stretches your mind to its limits
        -   helps you to concentrate and loose yourself in an activity


## Part 2 {#part-2}

Taking action.


### The Rules {#the-rules}


#### Rule #1: Work deeply {#rule-1-work-deeply}

<!--list-separator-->

-  By Roy Baumeister

    > You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. Your will, in
    > other words, is not a manifestation of yourcharacter that you can deploy without limit;
    > it's instead like a muscle that tires

    <!--quoteend-->

    > The key to developing a [deep work]({{< relref "../../topics/deep_work.md" >}}) habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines
    > and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower
    > necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration

<!--list-separator-->

-  Different philosophies

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Monastic

        > Knuth deploys what I call the monastic philosophy of [deep work]({{< relref "../../topics/deep_work.md" >}}) scheduling. This philosophy
        > attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing [shallow]({{< relref "../../topics/shallow_work.md" >}})
        > obligations. Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and
        > highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing, and the bulk of their professional
        > success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Bimodal

        > Jung's approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of [deep work]({{< relref "../../topics/deep_work.md" >}}). This philosophy asks
        > that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and
        > leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will
        > act monastically---seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow
        > time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can
        > happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a
        > four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year,
        > you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do
        > over the summer or while on sabbatical).

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Rhythmic

        > This chain method (as some now call it) soon became a hit among writers and fitness
        > enthusiasts---communities that thrive on the ability to do hard things consistently. For
        > our purposes, it provides a specific example of a general approach to integrating depth
        > into your life: the rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to
        > consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.
        > **The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for
        > you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep**. The chain method is
        > a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a
        > simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself
        > to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Journalistic

        > I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the
        > journalist philosophy. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like Walter
        > Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment's notice, as is required by
        > the deadline-driven nature of their profession

    -  The 4 Discipline of Execution

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #1 Focus on the wildly importante

            -   Aim to for a small number of wildly importantly goals
            -   Let ambitious goals drove focus driven behaviour
                -   The Art of Focus (David Brooks)

                    > "If you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial
                    > distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the
                    > subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd
                    > out everything else."

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #2 Act on the lead measures

            -   2 types of metrics to measure the your goal

            <!--list-separator-->

            -  Lag measures

                -   Lag measures describe the thing you're ultimately trying to improve
                -   the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: "When you receive them, the
                    performance that drove them is already in the past."

            <!--list-separator-->

            -  Lead measures

                -   Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.
                -   For an individual focused on [deep work]({{< relref "../../topics/deep_work.md" >}}), it's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of [deep work]({{< relref "../../topics/deep_work.md" >}}) dedicated toward your wildly important goal
                    -   Don't track how many books, articles you've read
                    -   Measure instead how many hours of deep work you've mastered

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #3 Keep the a compelling scoreboard

            > "People play differently when they're keeping score," the 4DX authors explain. They then elaborate that when attempting
            > to drive your team's engagement toward your organization's wildly important goal, it's important that they have a public
            > place to record and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus
            > on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation.
            > Once the team notices their success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this performance.

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  #4 Create a Cadence of Accountability

            -   The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place "a rhythm of regular and

            frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal."

            -   multiple places throughout this book I discuss and recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead (see Rule #4). During my experiments with 4DX, I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to adjust my schedule to meet the needs of my lead measure---enabling significantly more than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.


#### Rule #2: Embrace boredom {#rule-2-embrace-boredom}

-   Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you'll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom

> Don't Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus

-   **Productively Meditation**

    > The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you're occupied
    > physically but not mentally---walking, jogging, driving, showering---and focus your
    > attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession,
    > this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof,
    > or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must
    > continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls

#### Rule #3: Quit social media {#rule-3-quit-social-media}

-   Chose your tools
    -   The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts
-   Social media as source of distraction
    -   They're just products, developed by private companies, fundedlavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture thensell your personal information and attention to advertisers. They can befun, but in the scheme of your life and what you want to accomplish,they're a lightweight whimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

-   A commitment to is not a moral stance and it's not aphilosophical statement
    -   it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that [gets valuable things done]({{< relref "getting_things_done_the_art_of_stress_free_productivity.md" >}})


## From Top Performer {#from-top-performer}


### Why deep work is important for new skills {#why-deep-work-is-important-for-new-skills}

Cal explains why **Deep Work** is essential for acquiring new skills and mentions 2 aspects:

-   **Neuronal Activity**

    When focusing intensely on a task without distraction, the related neuronal
    circuit in the brain is repeatedly activated in a clean, focused manner, with
    minimal noise or distractions. This repeated firing of the same neural circuit
    in isolation prompts certain cells to build [myelin]({{< relref "../../topics/myelin.md" >}}) sheaths around the neurons,
    acting as insulators. This process allows neurons to fire more easily and
    quickly, enhancing the brain's efficiency. This mechanism is crucial for
    cementing new skills, whether cognitive or physical, into our neural processes

-   **Attention Residue**

     Newport describes the phenomenon of "attention residue," where shifting focus
    from one target to another leaves a residue of the first target in the mind,
    lasting up to 30 minutes. This residue reduces cognitive performance, as
    measured by a drop in IQ points when people frequently check distractions like
    emails or social media. This constant state of attention residue results in
    working at reduced capacity. Deep work counters this by leveraging the
    principles of cognitive science and neuroscience to maximize brain efficiency
    during focused work session

> SCOTT: You and I have done a lot of deep work, but I think you have done all the
> research behind it, so I’m interested, what is the reason why doing this kind of
> concentrated work is just so much more effective, particularly for these
> deliberate practice projects that the people who are watching this are going to
> be caring about?
>
> CAL: It’s a good question. If you dive into the research, there are really two
> reasons why we know that deep work produces a lot of work and helps you learn
> complicated things in a short amount of time.
>
> The first reason has to do with the neurons in your head. When you’re focusing
> intensely on a task without distraction, what’s happening in your head is that
> the neuronal circuit related to that activity is firing again and again very
> cleanly. There is not a lot of noise that is getting your attention. The way
> that the neural system works, is that if you fire the same circuit again and
> again in isolation, some cells come along and begin to build sheaths of a
> substance called myelin around the cell bodies. This acts like an insulator. Now
> the neurons can fire easier, and they can fire quicker than they could before.
>
> Doing deep work when you’re trying to learn a hard new task, be it cognitive or
> even physical, is exactly what is required for the neural process of cementing a
> new skill in the neurons. The second reason why we know deep work is so
> effective is exactly how you experienced. There’s an effect called “attention
> residue” that causes real issues, and I think it’s being overlooked. Essentially
> the effect is as follows: If you have your attention on one target and then you
> shift your attention to another target, that original target leaves a residue in
> your head that can last 10, 20, up to 30 minutes. As long as that residue is
> there, you’re at a reduced cognitive performance. They can measure the number of
> IQ points you drop if you have just checked Facebook or if you just checked your
> email, and it’s a lot. If, like a lot of people, the way you work is you’re
> mainly focusing on one thing but every 10 or 15 minutes, you check your email or
> check a browser tab, you’re keeping yourself in a constant state of attention
> residue, which means you’re keeping yourself working at a reduced capacity.
>
> Deep work really leverages both of those truths from cognitive science and
> neuroscience to make sure you’re getting the most out of your brain for the time
> you have to spend on the task at hand.
