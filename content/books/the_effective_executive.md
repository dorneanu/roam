After reading Cal Newportâ€™s book on "[deep work]({{< relref "deep_work_rules_for_focused_success_in_a_distracted_world.md" >}})", listening to his podcast on productivity
and time management, this book felt like a waste of time. There are tons of other good
books on productivity, time management/self-management. This one is definitely not a good
one.
