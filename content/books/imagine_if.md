## Notes {#notes}


### Note 1 {#note-1}

> -   Imagine if we used our incredible capacities to create a world in which every person had a deep understanding of their own unique talents.
> -   Imagine if we built systems that lifted us up instead of keeping us down.
> -   Imagine if we embraced our diversities rather than running from them.
>
> We have come to a point in our history in which continuing to do what we have
> always done is no longer an option. We must do better. It begins, as it always
> does, with each of us taking a stand.


### Note 2 - Creativity {#note-2-creativity}

Definition:

> Creativity—the **ability to generate new ideas and to apply them in practice**

<!--quoteend-->

> Creativity is a process, which means it includes a relationship between two main
> aspects that bounce off each other:
>
> -   **generating ideas** and
> -   **evaluating ideas**

<!--quoteend-->

> Creativity involves [originality]({{< relref "originals.md" >}})

<!--quoteend-->

> Creativity involves making **judgments of value**. What is considered to be of value
> depends on the nature and the purpose of the work — if something is useful,
> beautiful, valid, or sustainable

<!--quoteend-->

> Creativity is call and response: **one idea can catalyze a multitude more in the
> minds of other people**

<!--quoteend-->

> Creativity, like the brain or muscle, **changes with use. If we neglect our
> creative capacities, they lie dormant**. If we use them properly, they grow and
> develop.


### Note 3 {#note-3}

> Every generation lives through its own unique set of circumstances, and in doing
> so leaves indelible marks for future generations to make sense of. The **unique
> set of circumstances** we find ourselves navigating are in part born from the
> crosscurrents of **three global forces**:
>
> -   demography
> -   technology
> -   ideology


### Note 4 {#note-4}

Many of man-kind problems are spiritual:

> Despite our unprecedented material comforts, life in the twenty-first century is
> proving too much to bear for growing numbers of people. **Many of the problems we
> are experiencing are spiritual. I mean that in the sense of being in good
> spirits or poor spirits: of feeling purposeful and fulfilled, or nihilistic and
> despairing**. While the majority of people are materially better off than ever
> before, a large portion are caught in a global epidemic of depression and
> anxiety.


### Note 5 - Save our own existence {#note-5-save-our-own-existence}

> It is often said that we have to “save the planet.” I’m not so sure that’s
> true—the planet has a long time left to run until it crashes into the Sun. What
> we mean when we talk about saving the planet is that **we have to save our own
> existence on it**. That much is certain. If we continue to ravage the Earth at the
> current rate, we face no future as a species. Extinctions are a very real part
> of nature, but **at this rate humans will join an elite and unfortunate club of
> species directly responsible for their own extinction**.


### Note 6 - IQ {#note-6-iq}

> in 1912 German psychologist William Stern proposed implementing a formal
> calculation of mental age divided by chronological age multiplied by 100 to
> determine a specific IQ figure.

<!--quoteend-->

> Ask most people about intelligence and the conversation usually turns to
> academic ability and IQ (Intelligence Quotient). “Academic” is often used
> interchangeably with “intelligent,” but while academic ability is an important
> example of intelligence, it is far from being the whole of it.
>
> **Academic work** is a mode of analysis that can be applied to anything. It refers
> to **intellectual work** that is mainly theoretical or scholarly, rather than
> practical or applied. Working academically generally **focuses on three areas**:
>
> -   **propositional knowledge**
>     — facts about what is the case, for example, “George Washington was president of the United States of America from 1789 to 1797”;
> -   **critical analysis**
>     — the impact of Washington’s presidency and the nature of his leadership;
> -   **desk studies**
>     — which mainly involve reading and writing, processing and presenting facts, and critical analysis.


### Note 7 - IQ and Eugenics {#note-7-iq-and-eugenics}

> The concept of IQ was eventually picked up by members of the **eugenics** movement,
> who used it as **grounds for their belief in selective breeding and population
> control**. Their argument was that the IQ test could be used to identify people
> with low intelligence and stop them from reproducing. It caught on—some states
> in the USA legalized the sterilization of people deemed to have low
> intelligence, and **eugenics was a key tactic of the Nazis’ Final Solution**.

Some facts about eugenics:

-   The eugenics movement aimed to improve the genetic quality of the human population through controlled breeding, sterilization or exclusion of certain groups from society.
-   This movement was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
-   Eugenics was associated with racist and xenophobic beliefs.
-   The movement impacted policies related to immigration, marriage, and reproductive rights in several countries.
-   The Nazi regime in World War II utilized eugenics to further their own agenda.
-   Eugenics lost popularity after the end of the Nazi regime.


### Note 8 - Differences between learning, school {#note-8-differences-between-learning-school}

> There are a few terms that are often confused or used
> interchangeably:
>
> -   learning
> -   education
> -   training
> -   school
>
> but there are important differences between them.
>
> -   **Learning** is the process of acquiring new skills and understanding.
> -   **Education** is an organized system of learning.
> -   **Training** is a type of education that is focused on learning specific skills
> -   A **school** is a community of learners: a group that comes together to learn with and from each other.


### Note 9 - Role of School {#note-9-role-of-school}

> There should be three **cultural priorities for schools**:
>
> -   to help students **understand** their **own cultures**
> -   to understand **other cultures**
> -   to promote a **sense of cultural tolerance and coexistence**.


### Note 10 - Separation of areas/subjects {#note-10-separation-of-areas-subjects}

> **The conventional curriculum is based on a collection of separate subjects**. These
> are prioritized according to beliefs around the limited understanding of
> intelligence we discussed in the previous chapter, as well as what is deemed to
> be important later in life.
>
> The idea of “subjects” suggests that each subject, whether mathematics, science,
> art, or language, stands completely separate from all the other subjects. This
> is problematic. **Mathematics, for example, is not defined only by propositional
> knowledge; it is a combination of types of knowledge, including concepts,
> processes, and methods as well as propositional knowledge**.
>
> This is also true of science, art, and languages, and of all other subjects. It
> is therefore much more useful to focus on the concept of disciplines rather than
> subjects.


### Note 11 - Traditional schooling {#note-11-traditional-schooling}

Traditional methods of formal education compared to an industrial factory:

-   _Children_ are **manufactured** in a linear process along a conveyor belt
-   _Teachers_ are like **factory workers**
-   _Quality control_ checks along the way
-   Process is **routine**, predefined, and regulated

Mixed groups of children learning together:

> In traditional schools, children are taught in specific age groups — all of the
> seven-year-olds together in one group, separate from all of the nine-year-olds.
> From an administrative point of view, this makes sense. It also makes sense from
> the perspective of industrial priorities.
>
> However, when it comes to **what and how children actually learn, segregation by
> age makes little sense at all**. **When children of different ages learn together,
> they can be grouped by their stage of mastery rather than their chronological
> age**. The younger students can benefit from the relative sophistication of the
> older ones, who reinforce their own learning by helping the younger ones. In
> bringing a variety of ages together, the experience, knowledge, and ability of
> each is enhanced. It also provides opportunities for children to nurture each
> other, developing empathy, responsibility, and patience.

<!--quoteend-->

> Despite the astronomical changes in circumstances between the Industrial
> Revolution and the twenty-first century, formal systems of education by and
> large remain structurally the same.
>
> **Students and teachers spend huge amounts of their time in conditions that have
> been designed for the mass production of a standardized product, the student,
> that by design focuses on output and yield**.
>
> While industrial farms prioritize quantity, size, and cost over quality, health,
> and natural ecosystems, we prioritize test data, attendance, and college
> admission over well-being, creativity, and learning. **While industrial farms pump
> crops and livestock with vast amounts of antibiotics, we prescribe
> mood-stabilizing and attention-enhancing drugs to children to compensate for the
> very real levels of anxiety, stress, and disengagement they are experiencing**.

  <span class="table-number"><a href="#table--tbl:tradschooling">Table 1</a>:</span>
  Traditional schooling vs. what really matters
</div>

| Industrial priorities | What really matters |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| quantity              | quality             |
| size                  | health              |
| cost                  | natural ecosystems  |
| test data             | well-being          |
| attendance            | creativity          |
| college admission     | learning            |

How schedule is disrupting children's attention:

> The **purpose of the schedule** is to facilitate learning. Rather than rotating
> teachers and students through the day from room to room and subject to subject,
> the schedule should be sensitive to the needs and requirements of each activity.
>
> **If a business required that its entire workforce stop what it was doing every
> forty minutes to move to a different room and do something else entirely, the
> business would rapidly grind to a halt**.
>
> When you think of it in those terms, it seems ridiculous that the majority of
> schools put their students and teachers through this bizarre routine. Not only
> is it a strange concept to expect human beings to stop what they are doing and
> physically move rooms at the sound of a bell, it is also counterintuitive for
> learning.


### Note 12 - Playing {#note-12-playing}

> Play is not only a fundamental aspect of learning, but also a child’s natural
> expression of it and a critical aspect of developing curiosity and imagination.
> In the case of play, the **most effective action a school can take is to stand
> aside and let it happen. Children do not need lessons in how to play, nor do
> they need to be overly surveilled or scheduled—they simply require the space and
> freedom to do what they naturally do best**.


### 8 Core competencies {#8-core-competencies}

> The concept of disciplines brings us to a better starting point when planning
> the curriculum, which is to ask what students should know and be able to do as a
> result of their education.
>
> The four purposes above suggest eight core competencies that, if properly
> integrated into education, will equip students who leave school to engage in the
> personal, cultural, economic, and social challenges they will inevitably face in
> their lives. These competencies are curiosity, creativity, criticism,
> communication, collaboration, compassion, composure, and citizenship

-   Communication

    The ability to express thoughts and feelings clearly and
    confidently in a range of media and forms
-   Criticism

    The ability to analyze information and ideas and to form reasoned
    arguments and judgments
-   Collaboration

    The ability to work constructively with others

    Humans are social creatures:

    > The human adventure can only be carried forward through complex forms of
    > collaboration. Without the ability to work with others we would stand no chance
    > against the challenges we collectively face. Fortunately, human beings are
    > social creatures: we live and learn in the company of others. This is true in
    > most situations, but seldom cultivated in school environments. Too often, young
    > people learn in groups but not as groups.

-   Compassion

    The ability to empathize with others and to act accordingly
-   Composure

    The ability to connect with the inner life of feeling and develop a
    sense of personal harmony and balance
-   Citizenship

    The ability to engage constructively with society and to participate
    in the processes that sustain it


### Note 13 {#note-13}

Again and again we don't have that much time on this planet (see [4 Thousand Weeks - Time Management for Mortals]({{< relref "4_thousand_weeks_time_management_for_mortals.md" >}})):

> In Western cultures we avoid death. Not the act itself, but acknowledging
> it, talking about it, and processing what it really means. As a result, too many
> people live as though it will never happen to them or the people they love. They
> endure their lives, get through each week, and wait for the weekend. As life
> goes on they increasingly feel they have lost their chance to be happy and
> fulfilled.


### Note 14 - Separation between body and mind {#note-14-separation-between-body-and-mind}

> **The dominant Western worldview is not based on seeing synergies and connections,
> but on making distinctions and seeing differences**. This **creates sharp
> distinctions between the mind and the body and between human beings and the rest
> of nature**. This may be why there is such a general lack of understanding about
> how the food we consume directly affects how our bodies work, and that the mass
> production of the goods we demand directly affects the health of the planet.
> page


### Note 15 {#note-15}

We're the problem:

> The crises in the worlds of nature and human resources are connected. Jonas
> Salk, the scientist who developed the Salk polio vaccine, reportedly made the
> observation that **if all the insects were to disappear from the earth, within
> fifty years all other forms of life would end. But if all human beings were to
> disappear from the earth, within fifty years all other forms of life would
> flourish.** In other words, we have now become the problem.


### Note 16 {#note-16}

> As David Attenborough observed: **We have come as far as we have because we are
> the cleverest creatures to have ever lived on Earth. But if we are to continue
> to exist, we will require more than intelligence. We will require wisdom**.


### Noten 17 {#noten-17}

> So, if revolutions are not government-led initiatives, how do they begin? One
> insight, attributed to **Benjamin Franklin**, is that **there are three sorts of
> people in the world: those who are immovable, those who are movable, and those
> who move**.
